# LLM Guide Step 7: Embedding Visualization

## Overview
Create educational visualizations for how tokens get converted into embeddings and processed through the transformer model.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate synthetic embedding representations
- [ ] Create vector space visualization
- [ ] Show embedding dimensionality concepts
- [ ] Implement attention weight visualization
- [ ] Display transformer layer processing
- [ ] Add interactive exploration features
- [ ] Educational explanations for vector concepts

## Technical Details

### Embedding Representation
Since we can't access actual Claude embeddings, create educational approximations:
- Generate synthetic high-dimensional vectors
- Show dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE concepts)
- Demonstrate semantic similarity through distance
- Visualize embedding lookup table concept

### Vector Visualizations
```typescript
interface EmbeddingVisualization {
  tokenEmbeddings: {
    token: string;
    vector: number[]; // Simplified representation
    similarity: number; // To other tokens
    position2D: {x: number; y: number}; // For 2D visualization
  }[];
  dimensions: number;
  layerDepth: number;
}
```

### Interactive Features
- 2D projection of embedding space
- Token similarity heat map
- Attention weight visualization (simplified)
- Layer-by-layer processing simulation
- Hover effects showing vector values

### Educational Components
1. **Embedding Lookup** - Show token-to-vector conversion
2. **Semantic Space** - Demonstrate how similar tokens cluster
3. **Attention Mechanism** - Visualize which tokens "pay attention" to others
4. **Layer Processing** - Show how embeddings transform through layers

### Visualization Types
- Scatter plot for semantic space
- Heat map for attention weights
- Bar charts for individual vector dimensions
- Network graph for attention patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on educational accuracy over technical precision
- Use D3.js foundations (prepare for next phase)
- Create reusable visualization utilities
- Ensure responsive design for mobile
- Keep performance reasonable with simplified calculations

### Synthetic Data Generation
- Create plausible embedding values for education
- Generate attention patterns based on token relationships
- Use semantic heuristics for token similarity
- Make examples that reinforce learning concepts

## Definition of Done
- Embedding visualizations display correctly
- Interactive features enhance understanding
- Synthetic data feels realistic and educational
- Performance is acceptable for real-time updates
- Components integrate with existing step visualization
- Educational value is clear for target audience
