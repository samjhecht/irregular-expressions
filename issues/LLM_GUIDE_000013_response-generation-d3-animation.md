## Technical Details

### Advanced Visualization Components

#### Probability Distribution Animation

```typescript
interface GenerationVisualization {
  generationSteps: GenerationStep[]
  samplingStrategies: SamplingStrategy[]
  probabilityDistributions: TokenProbability[][]
  beamSearchPaths?: BeamPath[]
  parameters: SamplingParameters
}

interface TokenProbability {
  token: string
  probability: number
  rank: number
  selected: boolean
  reasoning: string
}

interface BeamPath {
  id: string
  tokens: string[]
  logProbability: number
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'pruned'
}
```

#### Interactive Controls

- Temperature slider with real-time distribution updates
- Top-k and top-p parameter adjustments
- Sampling strategy selector with live comparison
- Generation speed control for animations
- Reset and replay functionality

### D3.js Animation Features

#### Probability Bar Chart Animation

#### Token Generation Flow

1. **Context Processing**: Show how previous tokens influence next
2. **Logit Calculation**: Animate raw model outputs
3. **Probability Conversion**: Visualize softmax transformation
4. **Sampling Animation**: Show different strategies in action
5. **Token Selection**: Highlight chosen token with celebration animation

#### Branching Path Visualization

- Tree structure showing different possible generations
- Animated pruning for beam search demonstration
- Path highlighting for selected generation route
- Probability accumulation along paths
- Interactive exploration of alternative generations

### Educational Comparisons

#### Strategy Side-by-Side View

- **Temperature Sampling**: Show randomness effects
- **Top-K**: Demonstrate vocabulary filtering
- **Top-P (Nucleus)**: Show dynamic vocabulary cutoff
- **Beam Search**: Multiple hypothesis tracking

#### Parameter Effect Demonstrations

- Temperature: 0.1 → 1.0 → 2.0 with live updates
- Top-K: Show how vocabulary restriction affects creativity
- Top-P: Demonstrate adaptive filtering
