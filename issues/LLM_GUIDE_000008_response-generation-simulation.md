# LLM Guide Step 8: Response Generation Simulation

## Overview
Implement educational simulation of how the LLM generates its response, including sampling strategies, probability distributions, and token selection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Simulate token-by-token generation process
- [ ] Display probability distributions for next tokens
- [ ] Show different sampling strategies (greedy, top-k, top-p)
- [ ] Animate the generation process
- [ ] Connect generated tokens back to actual response
- [ ] Add controls for sampling parameters
- [ ] Educational explanations for generation strategies

## Technical Details

### Generation Simulation
Create educational approximation of response generation:
- Token-by-token probability simulation
- Multiple sampling strategy demonstrations
- Temperature effects on randomness
- Beam search concepts (simplified)

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface GenerationStep {
  position: number;
  context: string[];
  candidates: TokenCandidate[];
  selectedToken: string;
  samplingStrategy: 'greedy' | 'top-k' | 'top-p' | 'temperature';
  reasoning: string;
}

interface TokenCandidate {
  token: string;
  probability: number;
  logit: number;
  rank: number;
}
```

### Interactive Features
- Play/pause generation animation
- Adjust sampling parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p)
- Compare different sampling strategies side-by-side
- Hover over generated tokens for selection reasoning
- Step-by-step generation breakdown

### Educational Components
1. **Probability Calculation** - Show how logits become probabilities
2. **Sampling Strategies** - Compare greedy vs stochastic approaches
3. **Temperature Effects** - Demonstrate creativity vs consistency
4. **Context Window** - Show how previous tokens influence selection
5. **End-of-Sequence** - Explain stopping criteria

### Visualization Elements
- Probability bar charts for token candidates
- Generation timeline showing selected path
- Comparison panels for different strategies
- Temperature slider with real-time effects
- Context window highlighting

## Implementation Notes
- Create plausible probability distributions based on actual response
- Use smooth animations for token generation
- Make parameter controls educational and intuitive
- Ensure explanations are accurate but accessible
- Design for different response lengths and types

### Sampling Strategy Simulations
- **Greedy**: Always pick highest probability token
- **Top-K**: Sample from top K most likely tokens
- **Top-P (Nucleus)**: Sample from cumulative probability mass P
- **Temperature**: Adjust randomness of probability distribution

## Definition of Done
- Generation simulation runs smoothly with animations
- All sampling strategies are demonstrated clearly
- Interactive controls work and provide educational value
- Probability displays are accurate and informative
- Component connects user's actual response to simulation
- Performance remains good with complex visualizations
