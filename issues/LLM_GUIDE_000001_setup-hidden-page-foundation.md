# LLM Guide Step 1: Setup Hidden Page Foundation

## Overview
Set up the basic page structure for the interactive LLM guide as a hidden page in the existing Next.js site.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create new hidden page content structure in contentlayer config
- [ ] Add LLM guide MDX file in `content/_hidden-pages/`
- [ ] Create basic page layout following existing hidden page patterns
- [ ] Ensure page is non-discoverable (not in navigation/sitemap)
- [ ] Verify page renders with existing Chakra UI theming

## Technical Details

### Contentlayer Configuration
- Extend existing `HiddenPage` document type or create new `LLMGuidePage` type
- Ensure proper URL routing to `/hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms`

### Page Structure
- Basic MDX file with frontmatter (title, date, description)
- Placeholder content that can be replaced with interactive components
- Follow existing hidden page patterns for consistency

### Routing
- Create corresponding page component in `pages/hidden-pages/[slug].tsx`
- Ensure no links to page exist in navigation or public areas

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing `HiddenPage` component structure as template
- Maintain consistency with current site architecture
- Keep initial content minimal - focus on page setup only

## Definition of Done
- Page accessible at `/hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms`
- Page renders with site theming
- Page does not appear in public navigation
- No build errors or TypeScript issues

## Proposed Solution

I have implemented the foundation for the interactive LLM guide with the following steps:

### 1. Fixed Contentlayer Configuration Bug
- Fixed the HiddenPage URL resolver in `contentlayer.config.ts:87` that was incorrectly pointing to `/poetry/` instead of `/hidden-pages/`
- This ensures hidden pages render at the correct URL path

### 2. Created LLM Guide MDX File
- Created `content/_hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms.mdx` with:
  - Proper frontmatter including title, date, description, and thumbnail
  - Basic content structure outlining what the guide will cover
  - Status set to "draft" to indicate work in progress
  - Placeholder content that can be enhanced with interactive components

### 3. Verified Page Infrastructure
- Built contentlayer files successfully (49 documents generated)
- Started development server which is running on http://localhost:3000
- Page should be accessible at `/hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms`

### Implementation Notes
- Used existing `HiddenPage` document type - no new types needed
- Followed existing hidden page patterns and content structure
- Page inherits all site theming via existing layout component
- Page will not appear in navigation or public areas by design

## Next Steps for Testing
- Verify page renders correctly at the expected URL
- Confirm page styling matches site theme
- Test that page is not discoverable through navigation
## Implementation Results

âœ… **All acceptance criteria successfully completed**

### What Was Implemented

1. **Fixed Critical Bug in Contentlayer Configuration**
   - Fixed `contentlayer.config.ts:87` where HiddenPage URL resolver incorrectly pointed to `/poetry/` instead of `/hidden-pages/`
   - This bug would have prevented hidden pages from working properly

2. **Created LLM Guide MDX File**
   - File: `content/_hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms.mdx`
   - Proper frontmatter with title, date, description, thumbnail, and draft status
   - Basic content structure outlining guide objectives
   - Follows existing site patterns and conventions

3. **Verified Page Infrastructure**
   - Built contentlayer successfully (49 documents generated)
   - Page renders correctly at `/hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms`
   - Returns HTTP 200 status code
   - Page title renders correctly in HTML
   - Inherits site theming via existing layout component

4. **Confirmed Non-Discoverability**
   - Page does not appear in homepage navigation
   - Page does not appear in essays page or other public areas
   - Only accessible via direct URL knowledge

5. **Production Build Validation**
   - Successfully builds for production
   - Page included in static generation: `/hidden-pages/interactive-guide-to-llms (633 ms)`
   - No TypeScript compilation errors
   - All linting passes

### Technical Notes
- Used existing `HiddenPage` document type - no custom types needed
- Leveraged existing `hidden-pages/[slug].tsx` component structure
- Page uses same layout, styling, and view counter as other hidden pages
- Follows site's MDX content patterns and frontmatter conventions

### Ready for Next Phase
The foundation is now in place for building interactive components. The page is accessible, properly themed, and hidden from public discovery as required.
