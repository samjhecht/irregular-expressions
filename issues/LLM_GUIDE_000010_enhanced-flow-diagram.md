# LLM Guide Step 10: Enhanced Flow Diagram with D3.js

## Overview

Replace basic step visualization with sophisticated D3.js-powered flow diagrams that show the LLM lifecycle with smooth animations and interactive elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create animated flow diagram using D3.js
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between steps
- [ ] Add data flow visualization (tokens flowing through pipeline)
- [ ] Create interactive step nodes with hover effects
- [ ] Animate step expansion with morphing shapes
- [ ] Add progress indicators and completion states
- [ ] Ensure responsive design and mobile compatibility

## Technical Details

### Flow Diagram Architecture

- SVG-based node and link visualization
- Force-directed or hierarchical layout
- Animated transitions between states
- Interactive node selection and expansion
- Data flow particle animations

### Visualization Components

```typescript
interface FlowDiagramProps {
  steps: LLMStep[]
  currentStep?: string
  expandedSteps: string[]
  onStepClick: (stepId: string) => void
  promptData?: LLMProcessResponse
}

interface FlowNode {
  id: string
  x: number
  y: number
  radius: number
  color: string
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed'
  expandable: boolean
}
```

### D3.js Features

- **Force Simulation**: For organic node positioning
- **Path Animation**: Smooth curves connecting steps
- **Morphing Shapes**: Nodes expand/contract on interaction
- **Particle Systems**: Show data flowing between steps
- **Zoom and Pan**: Allow exploration of detailed areas

### Animation Sequences

1. **Initial Load**: Nodes appear with staggered animation
2. **Step Activation**: Highlight and pulse active step
3. **Expansion**: Smooth morphing when step expands
4. **Data Flow**: Particles move from input to output
5. **Completion**: Success animations and state changes

### Interactive Features

- Click nodes to expand/collapse
- Hover for preview information
- Drag to rearrange (if applicable)
- Zoom to focus on specific areas
- Keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Notes

- Build on D3 foundation from previous step
- Use D3 force simulation for dynamic layouts
- Implement smooth SVG morphing animations
- Consider performance with complex animations
- Ensure accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard support

### Animation Timing

- Stagger node appearances: 100ms delays
- Step transitions: 300ms ease-out
- Expansion animations: 500ms elastic easing
- Data flow particles: 2-3 second loops
- Hover responses: 150ms quick feedback

### Responsive Considerations

- Scale visualization based on container size
- Adjust node sizes for mobile screens
- Simplify animations on lower-powered devices
- Ensure touch interactions work properly

## Definition of Done

- Flow diagram renders with smooth D3.js animations
- All interactive features work correctly
- Animations enhance understanding without distraction
- Mobile and desktop experiences are both excellent
- Performance remains good with all animations
- Integration with existing step data works seamlessly
