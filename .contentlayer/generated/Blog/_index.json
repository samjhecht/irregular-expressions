      "raw": "\nI find Vietnam War history to be fascinating to study for a number of reasons.  It is riddled with irony, tradgedy, heroism (on both sides) and you end up learning so much about the soul of America by studying it.  I was recently pondering the following: What if instead of fighting the Vietnam war, the US had spent the money we spent on war on a lump-sum payment to the people of N. Vietnam as a sort of bribe to achieve its desired outcome without a horrific war.  \n\nObviously this alternate scenario could not have happened for many reasons, such as:\n- Leaders on neither side had an accurate understanding of how dark the war would get until several yars into the conflict\n- It's possible, if not likely, that the ideological power of socialism/communism at the time would have been too strong\n- The US leaders wouldn't have had a good means for calculating the amount to offer given the lack of visibility into the path the war would take in terms of lives lost and financial costs.\n\nHowever, I still think it's an interesting thought experiment with potential lessons to consider as we face future threats of conflict.  The threat of a conflict between the U.S. and China is especially relevant given that the magnitude of potential financial impacts are staggering.\n\nAlright, let's run the numbers.   In 1968, the population of the North was ~18.7 million.   The true cost of the war is a bit tricky to fully calculate, but for the sake of this thought experiment, let's go with an estimate from a [NYTimes article published in 1975](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/01/archives/us-spent-141billion-in-vietnam-in-14-years.html) that put the cost at $141B spent from 1961 through surrender.  That's about $7,450 per citizen of the north.  \n\nLet's say we dropped pamphlets all over the countryside to announce to the North Korean populace that we would give each citizen of North Vietnam $7,450 if the North:\n- Switched to our political system and adopted capitalism and a representative democracy\n- We'd optionally offer them a favorable trade partnership \n- We'd invest an additional $10B in their school system and other public works needed to pull off the transition at the government level.\n\nThe money for individuals would be held in escrow by the UN until a multi-lateral commission from the UN validated that the criteria had been met and then it would start paying out in the form of five annual cash payments.  You'd also need to come up with a creative way to do the payouts that would limit the risk of fraud and government officials embezzling the money.   \n\nAdjusting for inflation, that $7,450 would be the equivalent of $42,570 in December 2022 terms.   According to [the World Bank](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2022/11/23/vietnam-gdp-per-capita-a-full-breakdown/?sh=2bcff5df111b), the 2021 per capita income in Vietnam was $3,694.02.   So, in today's dollars and assuming today's per capita income, you'd be talking about giving each N. Vietnam citizen 11.5 years of income.   It's probably safe to assume the per capita income was vastly, vastly, vastly lower.  \n\nRegarding the cost estimates, that $141B is just accounting for military expenditures.   That includes things like soldiers' compensation, helicopters, bullets, bombs, fuel for ships and planes, etc.   It does not include additional expenses for things like the opportunity cost of what else we could have done with that money, the cost to our government, the foreign aid we had to dump into South Vietnam over the course of the war, etc.   It also doesn't include an estimate for the cost associated with almost 60k American soldiers being taken out of the workforce.  \n\n<Box display=\"flex\" maxWidth=\"lg\" sx={{alignContent: 'center', justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n    <Image\n    src=\"/images/hamburger_hill.png\"\n    alt=\"'Reaching Out' by Larry Burrows\"\n    width={400}\n    height={300}\n    caption=\"'Reaching Out' by Larry Burrows.

      "raw": "\nI recently read Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton and have been fascinated by the parallels between the rise of political factions during Washington’s first two terms and our current divisive political environment.  I also regret to say that I am learning that I haven’t always had a full picture of Thomas Jefferson, who I’ve always held in only the highest esteem.  In order to distill my thoughts, I am going to attempt to write them down.  In this essay, I will do my best to compare and contrast the early Republican Party that formed in Washington’s first two terms as President and the Republican Party of Donald Trump that we have today.   I will then attempt to distill my thoughts on a question I’ve been pondering for the last few years about whether I can distill the nature and motives of the Democratic and Republican ideologies down to their most basic principles.  \n\n<Box display=\"flex\" maxWidth=\"lg\" sx={{alignContent: 'center', justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n    <Image\n    src=\"/images/alexander-hamilton.png\"\n    alt=\"Alexander Hamilton\"\n    width={300}\n    height={400}\n    caption=\"Alexander Hamilton, oil on canvas by John Trumbull, c. 1792; in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\"\n    style= {{ objectFit: 'cover'}}\n    />\n</Box>\n\nFirst of all, it seems clear that Alexander Hamilton was a true genius and, apart from some notable but infrequent lapses during his heyday, generally a man of uncommon moral fiber and noble principles.  I think he has been under-appreciated in the teaching of American history, or at least in the version of American history that I was taught and that I know to be taught in much of the American South.  I imagine that this is partly a function of his enemies outliving him and rising to the heights of power after his death.  I do remember when I learned about him back in middle school.  I remember thinking similar thoughts then.  That it seemed to me that his impact on the founding of our nation was among the most important and that I was surprised that he was not depicted more prominently.   However, I also wonder if under-appreciation for Hamilton is to some extent a result of his opposition to Jefferson, Madison, and the descendant political faction that has maintained a powerful role in American society all the way to today’s Republican Party, and that has influenced the way that our history has been written.\n\nThat said, the first topic I sat down to write about today is the parallels between Thomas Jefferson’s Republican Party and the one we have today.   I was fascinated to learn that Jefferson and Madison seem to have also adopted a strategy of distributing misinformation, logically dubious and often unfair claims in order to achieve their goals.  Examples include:\n- Consistently reinforcing statements that Hamilton was a “monarchist” who was part of a secret cabal to overthrow the new US government and replace it with a monarchy.   They clearly must have known that wasn’t actually true given how well they knew Hamilton and how intelligent they clearly were.   On their intelligence, I’ll take it for granted that James Madison, for example, was also a man of uncommon intelligence given the fact that he is the foremost architect of the Constitution.  \n- Downplaying Hamilton’s bout with Yellow Fever and accusing him of faking it when he just had a common cold.  And questioning his bravery even though they knew his reputation in the Revolutionary War.  \n- They also frequently engaged with or employed morally dubious characters to do their dirty work.   Jefferson’s hiring of Phillip Freneau or his meetings with questionable characters in order to dig up dirt on Hamilton remind me somewhat of Trump’s use of Roger Stone or Alex Jones.  \n\nChernow also recounts examples of Jefferson’s hypocrisy that also strikes me as a parallel to examples I see in today’s Republican Party.   Jefferson had no reservations about accusing Hamilton of cowardice even though he didn’t fight in the revolution and demonstrated cowardice when serving as governor of VA.   I’m reminded of the recent notable example of Trump disparaging John McCain, despite having avoided serving in the military by manufacturing a case of “bone spurs”.   It pains me to learn these things about Jefferson.  As a Virginian and as an alum of the University of Virginia (“Mr. Jefferson’s University”), I’ve always idolized him as the writer of the Declaration of Independence, a founding father, a statesman and a polymath.   All of those things are true.  However, I hated to learn that Jefferson’s behavior during his tenure as Secretary of State sometimes bordered on treason.  For example, his clandestine discussions with the French emissary, Edmond-Charles Genêt after the French Revolution, in which he undermined George Washington and colluded with the emissary to help achieve France’s goals despite the fact that Washington and Hamilton would oppose them.  This story bears similarities to treasonous actions of several members of Trump’s administration or those of Nixon when he went around LBJ to communicate with the South Vietnamese government while he was running for president.  \n\nAnother parallel is the fervent belief that many of the Republican-identifying populace has in the fact that the Federalist or Democratic parties were going to doom America.   I do believe that many of the Republican “Trumpers” I know today do truly believe that the opposition will “ruin America”, even though they often aren’t actually able to articulate what that would even mean or look like.  In my opinion, this was much more understandable for the early Republicans.  The “American Experiment” was by no means sure to succeed in the early days.  They were also venturing through relatively uncharted waters given that many aspects of the American system were completely novel, the country had many notable weaknesses and there weren’t other variants of western democracies to compare and contrast against.  I also am inclined to believe that early Republican leaders like Madison and Jefferson also most likely truly believed that the objectives of Hamilton and the Federalists were a real threat to America and that their opposition to them was in the best interests of the nation.  I do not think that is the case in today’s Republican Party.  As I’ll explain later in this essay, I think many of the leaders of the Republican Party have entirely different and mostly selfish motives that they hide behind claims that they are trying to stop Democrats from ruining the country.  \n\nI previously considered listing the early Republican leaders’ respect for decorum, chivalry, and respect as a contrast to today’s republican leaders.  However, upon further reflection I’ve decided that I see parallels in addition to differences in that regard.   They certainly did speak and write more eloquently and they took care to publicly present themselves as honorable and respectful.   Jefferson took great care to use proxies to publish his disparagement of Hamilton and Madison used a pen name when doing so.  Contemporary Republican leaders like Trump, Lindsey Graham, or Sarah Palin, on the other hand, have no reservations about publicly disparaging their opponents both on the merits of their ideas and with typically false representations of their character or motives.   However, the similarity I see is in a willingness to stoop to playing dirty, using misinformation, or suspending logic in their arguments.  Jefferson’s Republicans may have disguised it better behind eloquence, chivalry or proxies, but the theme appears nonetheless.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are also certainly clear contrasts between the early Republican leaders and that of today.  I do think is worthwhile to recognize some here.  The first, and perhaps most obvious, difference is that the early Republican leaders like Madison and Jefferson were truly brilliant.   They were learned, well read and did a great deal to promote education and learning in the early days of the nation.  Madison, for example, founded James Madison University, which is located just over the Blue Ridge Mountains from the University of Virginia.  Both were eloquent and brilliant.   Jefferson was a polymath who was a self taught architect and inventor.   Madison was the primary architect of the Constitution.   Their uncommon intelligence cannot be in doubt.\n\nI also strongly believe that it’s important to appreciate the distinction between thematic similarities and the proportionality or degree to which a theme was perpetrated.  For example, kicking someone in the knee and shooting someone in the chest may both be examples of trying to injure an adversary, but they are vastly different in significance and their moral implications.  With that in mind, I think it’s worth pointing out that there is generally a wide disparity in the degree to which to which Jeffersonian republicans and Trump era Republicans perpetrate the behaviors noted above as common themes.  For example, while I think that it was technically treasonous for Jefferson to undermine Washington in his private meetings with Genet, I think it’s important to note that those actions were not in the same league of treason as Trump’s efforts to overthrow our Democracy on January 6th, 2021.   \n\nIn summary, I’d like to state emphatically my opinion that, when it comes to the merits of their character, accomplishments, intelligence, and their contributions to the founding of our nation, they are, in my opinion, vastly different from the likes of Trump, Sarah Palin, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Newt Gingrich, or Kevin McCarthy.  I have found it thought provoking to analyze the commonalities between the early right-wing faction and today’s in order to better understand the true nature of and motivations of the right, \n\nAs mentioned at the outset of this essay, I’ve been thinking for a while now about whether I could write an essay that managed to provide a simplified characterization of the Democratic and Republican parties.   From my own experience, I’ve seen how hard it can be to see through the external noise and arrive at your own judgements.  In fact, it took me until my mid-20s or even 30s to finally develop my own truly clear opinions about the Republican Party.   Previously they had always been influenced at all levels by the way I was taught American history and by the views of my parents and grandparents.   It seems to me that a lot of Americans struggle to see the true nature of the two parties as well.  I think that is due to a few reasons:\n- It’s difficult to see through the political slogans, propaganda and hype.   This is understandable, as the political narratives and marketing are explicitly designed for that purpose.   For example, Republicans labeling their abortion stance as “Pro Life”, gives a member of the opposite side the challenge of establishing that they are not “pro death” in addition to or before arguing the merits of their views on abortion, which is a much more nuanced and complicated topic than their black and white analogy to life or death would imply.  \n- The system itself gives a certain amount of gravity and respect to the either party on the basis of tradition.  The need for decorum and some degree of mutual respect in order for the system to function well also skews the left into having to perhaps demonstrate more respect for republican opponents than they deserve.\n- I am not a psychologist, but I tend to observe that we as humans have a cognitive deficiency when it comes to recognizing, remembering, and accounting for proportionality in our minds.   For example, you might see a contemporary Republican make an argument like, “You say that Democrats are honest and Trump is lying.  Well, what about when Clinton lied about Monica Lewinsky?  There are liars on both sides so why should I trust what Biden or Obama says is true?”\n\nOver the last eight years or so, I’ve managed to sort through those fingerprints of propaganda and my childhood education on my own conscious and subconscious feelings about our history and politics.  I’ve increasingly found myself having moments of clarity during which I found myself thinking “wait a minute?  Am I the only one who really sees what the modern Republican ideology really is at its most basic level?!”   It will of course be necessary to justify my opinions at length and I intend to do so, but I’ll start by stating it plainly that I think the true core motivation for aligning with Republican ideology among the general populace are fear, a generally pessimistic outlook on humanity, and a selfish desire to preserve and accumulate personal wealth.   This leaves that group of people vulnerable to leaders who are willing to exploit those motivations to achieve their primary motivation: power.   Another important variable is education and intelligence.  It seems to be that the more enlightened a citizen is, the more likely they are to move to the political left.   This can be offset in some cases if republican leaders can sufficiently exploit their fear or desire to preserve wealth in order to overcome the leftward pull that comes with education and logic.   \n\nIt seems to me that the Republican or Conservative party in America is set up to favor the wealthy and selfish.   The reality is that most of the people in Trump’s base would be better off voting for Democrats.   They would benefit from universal healthcare, student loan forgiveness, regulation on financial markets and big banks, and definitely from taxes on the wealthy to redistribute wealth back down to poor farmers, coal miners, and the middle class.  But the Republican Party has done a masterful job of marketing and has exhibited a talent for manipulating weaknesses in the human psyche.   For example, they make a big deal out of gun rights.  If they can make that a big enough topic, they can get voters to align with the party of not taxing the uber rich, even if that disadvantages those less wealthy gun owning voters.  Or Trump and others playing on the Christian vote.   If you can get your party associated with “not murdering babies”, you can get people to overlook the fact that you also want to deregulate big industry so you can get away with dumping pollutants into our waterways.   \n\nTo end this essay on a lighter note, I will share that another take-away I’ve had from Chernow’s book is that I really wish I could meet Alexander Hamilton.  He’s someone I would greatly like to have intellectual discussions with, to learn from, and likely would enjoy having as a friend.  \n",

      "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nRegardless of how we feel about the cause for which he fought, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was indisputably an excellent military commander.   While he earned his fame by \"standing like a stone wall...with his Virginians\" at First Bull Run and was a key contributor to the more famous and numerically larger victory at Chancellorsville, perhaps his greatest achievement as a military leader was his performance during his 1862 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley.   While much has been written of the detailed events of the campaign, Jackson's eccentricities, religious fanaticism, and the genius of his military tactics, I find it interesting to explore the interplay and relative importance of his religious beliefs and the conduct of tactics that ultimately won the day.  In this essay I will argue that, while his success in the Valley Campaign was the result of a number of different factors, it would not have been possible without his religious fanaticism.  His absolute faith provided him with a construct that allowed him to partition his thinking by drawing clear boundaries between what was within his control vs. what was outside of it, thereby removing a need for the types of doubt and second guessing that litter the histories of the blunders of other Civil War generals.  \n\nFinally, I will discuss what I think may be alternative methods that modern leaders might leverage to achieve the type of focus and freedom from emotion that Stonewall wielded, but without having to resort to a blind faith in a first century carpenter.\n\n## Background for Valley Campaign\n\nThe backdrop for Jackson's Valley Campaign was General George McClellan's famous \"Peninsula Campaign\", in which the latter ferried over 100,000 soldiers down the Potomac to Hampton Roads and moved up the peninsula with the aim of taking Richmond.   McClellan vastly outnumbered Joseph Johnston's (and eventually Robert E. Lee's) forced defending the Confederate capitol.  Jackson was initially dispatched to the Shenandoah Valley in late 1861 due to it's strategic importance to the Confederacy due to it's abundance of much needed livestock and agricultural supplies.   However, his campaign there in Spring 1862 was ultimately significant for the diversion it created to keep Federal troops from being able to join McClellan's outside Richmond during his Peninsula Campaign.   As an advisor to Jefferson Davis at the time, Robert E. Lee saw the threat of Gen. Irwin McDowell joining Gen. George McClellan and conveyed the situation to Jackson and told him the potential benefit to the broader military situation if he could present a threat to Washington, DC near Harpers Ferry.  Jackson eventually gathered a force of around ~17,000 men compared to a total of around 52,000 that eventually opposed him in the Shenandoah Valley under Banks, Fremont and McDowell.  Over the course of just 48 days, Jackson forced his men to march a blistering 646 miles, typically under detailed instructions to march for 50 minutes out of each hour and to spend the other ten minutes prone to maximize resting.  He seems to have personally slept rarely, moving with his men by day and studying his detailed maps at night in order to constantly adapt his strategy.   He outwitted and surprised his numerically superior opponents on multiple occasions and ultimately won several minor battles, capturing hundreds of prisoners, large amounts of supplies and completely routing Nathaniel Banks' army and sending it's soldiers fleeing back across the Potomac towards D.C.   The ultimate result was exactly what Lee had hoped for and, by occupying McDowell in the north, Jackson prevented him from reinforcing McClellan and may well have saved Richmond from falling less than two years into the war.   Abraham Lincoln himself is known to have been acutely aware of Jackson's skill in the Valley Campaign, as he was personally involved in developing Federal plans to counter him.\n\n\n## The Plight of a Civil War General\n\nIf one is to study the exploits of Civil War generals with an aim of learning lessons about what makes for a successful military leader and tactician, it seems relevant to consider just how different the situation was for Civil War generals relative to modern military leaders.   In particular, the typical Civil War general had to operate with far more limited communication abilities and vastly more limited intelligence sources, both in quantity and quality.   The Northern and Southern governments certainly did what they could to cultivate intelligence sources, but even at its best it was far more limited than what todays leaders often have to rely on.   There was no satellite surveillance or GPS navigation.   When maps were available, they were not always current or accurate.   Even when an informant arrived claiming to have personally witnessed an enemy movement or position, they lacked what we now consider a the simple technological miracle of being able to see proof of this report in the form of photographic evidence taken with a smartphone.  \n\nThey also often lacked the benefit of immediate bi-directional communication with their superiors, peers or supporting elements.   On the day of a planned assault, one general might be charged with waiting to hear the thunder of distant cannons to judge whether an allied unit had arrived and initiated their own assault, thereby indicating that their own attack should commence.  Once they were engaged, they could expect significant latency if they needed to get in touch with their superiors, if such communication was even possible at all.   For Jackson during the Valley Campaign, he would typically have been days away from reinforcements as well as days from being able to get a message to Richmond, let alone to then get a response.   In the midst of a battle, generals like Jackson were often severely limited in their ability to comprehend the status of their full command due to the simple constraints of line of sight and delays in communication.   For example, during the peninsula campaign McClellan was sometimes known to have personally climbed a tree with the hope of getting a better vantage point.   The constant dearth of basic battlefield intelligence was, in fact, what ultimately led to Stonewall's death at Fredericksburg -- with the desire to mount a night attack and finish off the union forces, he rode out beyond the lines with his staff officers to personally scout for a night attack and was shot down by nervous Confederate pickets who mistook his party for the enemy when they returned to the lines.  \n\nAn obvious effect of the lonely nature of being a Civil War general was the rollercoaster of disastrous defeats and heroic victories that makes studying the war so entertaining for many students and historians.   However, I find this dynamic makes for an especially interesting opportunity for a focused study of how specific individuals performed under adversity and in a communication vacuum.   Unlike today's leaders who can always rely on making a satellite or radio call to allies, superiors, or advisors, Jackson's isolation shines a spotlight on how his individual beliefs, attributes and personality contributed to battlefield outcomes.  \n\n\n## About Jackson\n\nIn the interest of brevity, I will refrain from providing extensive biographical information about Stonewall Jackson.   For those who are not already familiar with him, I highly recommend reading Shelby Foote's masterpiece or watching Ken Burns' documentary \"The Civil War\".   Or, if you're short on time, check out [the wikipedia page on him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson).   However, it is important to note some key facts about him.   First and potentially foremost, he was a religious fanatic.   His beliefs were present in everything he did--the way he communicated to his superiors and his men, the way he fought his battles (and when he fought them), and his attitude towards death and killing.  They even influenced the way he died, when he refused to take brandy for the pain when he lay dying from pneumonia after the amputation of his arm, saying that he wanted to keep his mind clear for when he went to meet the lord.   When his wife and doctor informed him that he would die that day, he replied \"Very good, very good.  I always wanted to die on a Sunday.\"  \n\nHe was a trained soldier and military leader, having graduated from West Point and working as a teacher at the Virginia Military Institute prior to the war, but his military exploits were far from being \"by the book\".   He was daring and versatile, remaining calm in the face of opportunity and dire threat, whether that threat was of being surrounded by adversaries or personally standing like \"a stone wall\" in the face of enemy fire.  He was ruthless towards the enemy and saw the killing of his opponents in a way that seems to have been purely tactical and non-emotional.   He was also rarely known to react emotionally to the deaths of his own men, although he was acutely aware of his need to preserve as many of his limited forces as possible for tactical and strategic value.\n\n\n## The Ingredients in Jackson's Recipe for Success\n\nBy his own account, Jackson would surely have listed \"God's blessing\" as the primary cause of his success, as he did shortly after the fact in writing to his wife that \"God has been our shield and to his name be all the glory.\"   While he was keen to give the credit to \"divine providence\", he was also brilliantly capable of distilling some of the core tactical and strategic \"rules\" that he had employed in achieving the outcome that \"providence\" had given him.   He said the following to one of his adjutants:\n\n\n> _Always mystify, mislead and surprise your enemy.  And when you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as your men have strength to follow, for an army routed, if hotly pursued, becomes panic stricken and can then be destroyed by half their number.  The other rule is never fight against heavy odds if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your own force on only a part—and at the weakest part—of your enemy and crush it.  Such tactics will win every time and a small army will thus destroy a large one in detail and repeated victory will make it invincible._\n\n\nJackson's rules could certainly fit right into a textbook on sound military doctrine.   However, these rules were not exactly foreign to many other Civil War leaders on both sides.   It's hard to imagine McClellan or Grant choosing an alternate approach if faced with similarly inferior numbers.   What's more interesting to me is what allowed him to stay focused on a day-to-day basis and avoid the tendency for second guessing that so famously plagued other generals like McClellan or Jackson's opponent at Chancellorsville, Joe Hooker, who after the battle admitted that he had \"lost confidence in Joe Hooker\".   \n\nBeyond the military principals found in Jackson's rules above, there were a number of other factors that, if missing, could have changed the outcome of the campaign.   \n\n### 1. His confidence and ability to take risks with conviction and no hesitation   \n  \n  It's one thing to believe in your heart that you need to \"mystify, mislead and surprise your enemy\".   It's another to pull it off, especially when operating in a communication vacuum with limited intelligence.\n  \n### 2. His ability to push his men beyond what more compassionate generals might have considered to be their limit   \n  \n  Out of necessity, Jackson pushed his men to march unusually hard and long in order to out-maneuver and surprise his opponents.   So much so that they began to be referred to as \"Jackson's foot cavalry\".   He kept a cool aloofness from the rank and file, showing no sympathy for men who collapsed from exhaustion.   When told that a runner had died from enemy fire when delivering a message for him, he simply replied \"very commendable, very commendable\", and calmly moved on with what he was doing.   This degree of cold, emotionless leadership was far from the norm among Civil War generals.   Lee often appealed to emotion and the deep love his men developed for him.   McClellan told his troops he saw it as his duty to look after them like a parent.  Grant perhaps came closer during his Overland Campaign in 1864, but he was known to be capable of deep remorse and emotion at the loss of his men.\n\n### 3. His own personal endurance  \n\n He doesn’t seem to have been much for sleeping.   I suspect he had an ability to not sleep much and instead be able to stay up studying his detailed maps and hatching plans.  \n\n### 4. A healthy dose of luck, coupled with an eye for recognizing opportunities and a presence of mind to move quickly to exploit them  \n\nYes, there certainly were lots of lucky moments and events.   Some include well timed rainstorms and hailstorms.    These presented a variety of benefits, such as swelling rivers but also being so extreme that any normal general would consider them a reason to halt a column.  But not Jackson.  He saw the “hail the size of a hens egg” as a blessing that would allow him to push his men to take the literal bruises and march through it while the enemy hesitated.  \n\n### 5. His ability to have no hesitation when it came to killing the enemy  \n\n He was clear minded and untroubled by his conviction that his objective was to destroy them.   I suspect his religious views served a purpose here as well.  It must have been a mechanism that let him simply put sympathy and hesitation out of his mind.  At one point during the Valley Campaign, one of his subordinates reported having successfully defended against a cavalry charge but stated that it was a shame to have killed Union troops who had demonstrated such bravery.  Jackson reproached him, making it clear that that he wanted as many dead as possible so there would be that many fewer to fight him next time.\n \n### 6. A genuine love of battle that was unmitigated by emotions like fear and sadness\n\n It does also seem relevant that he genuinely seems to have loved battle.  I suspect he liked the adrenaline rush and accompanying mental focus.  However, his religious fervor once again seems likely to have been relevant here as well.   For most people, the thrill of battle is balanced by other emotions such as confusion and a horrible fear of injury or death.   Jackson had complete faith that there was nothing to fear about the Heaven that awaited him, leaving him to bask in the adrenaline high of combat. \n\nCredit for his successes has often been attributed, in part, to the fact that he had large, detailed and extremely accurate maps of the theater that his opponents did not have access to.  For example, Ken Burns and Shelby Foote both note this in their respective histories on the subject.   However, I have not included this factor in the list above because it's not clear to me that he would have failed if he had only had somewhat less detailed maps.   It seems possible that he could have compensated for shortcomings of inferior maps either by leaning on his resourcefulness, quick thinking, and the likely presence of Virginian soldiers in his force who knew the terrain.\n\n## The Role of Jackson's Religious Fervor\n\nIn addition to the list of factors documented above, I would argue that his deeply held religious views were also a factor that contributed to his success.   Furthermore, I would argue that, while his intelligence, tactical brilliance, famously excellent maps, and luck were all necessary factors, they may not have been enough without adding his religious fanaticism.   Were he alive today, I could imagine that Jackson himself would claim to see \"the hand of God\" in each of the other factors.  \n\nI suspect it let him have the mental safety to let go of things outside his control by telling himself they were up to the almighty.   That way he’s able to take risks without constant second guessing himself and gave him an ever-at-hand defense against emotions like fear or compassion that might cloud his judgement.   It's not difficult to imagine the types of questions that the average person might have struggled with if they found themselves in Jacksons position.   Imagine you had four hours to try and get some sleep between two twenty hour days of marching--on a knife edge between disaster and potential victory.   Might your sleep-deprived, adrenaline soaked brain have spiraled through the plethora of totally reasonable questions on which your plan depended?  \"What if the Fremont and Shields didn't stop marching during the hailstorm either and are closer than I hope?   What if Ewell's troops don't show up in time to allow my plan to come together?   What if hundreds or thousands of my men end up dying if I make the wrong decision?!  How will I ever forgive myself if I make a judgement error that causes the destruction of my command!?\"  It certainly makes it easier to focus on what you can control and on taking decisive action if you can fend off such questions by remembering that those things are \"up to divine providence\" and that, if anything, you'd be insulting God by spending time stressing about them as though you didn't trust him to deliver you to whatever outcome he sees fit.   \n\nHis religious faith would have allowed him to compartmentalize things so he could stay laser focused on what was in his control.   Without this tool, he might not have been able to quickly capitalize on the noteworthy instances of luck that came his way, to ignore the complaints of his exhausted troops (some of whom were literally passing out on the march), and to accomplish so much in 48 short days without getting distracted by the overall dire state of Confederate military affairs at the time.\n\nOne could perhaps question whether my arguments above are assigning too much credit to his religious fervor without any good way to know for sure what really was going on in Jackson's mind.   What if he was just one of those people who don't really get anxiety?   Maybe he was just really good at clearing his mind and focusing?  It is possible that he simply had the type of mind that was exceptionally good at decisive action and immune from emotion and second guessing.   In fact, to some extent that was likely the case regardless of the role of religion.   However, a litany of primary sources make it clear that his religion was one of the things that defined him and was present in almost everything he ever wrote or said.    His was an \"army of the living God\" and he was known to have said that \"my religious belief reaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.\"  Given the degree to which history has documented his Presbyterian fervor, I believe that we can conclude that it was a part of the bedrock of his mental framework.   \n\n\n### So What?  Should we All Become Presbyterians? \n\nIn the case of Stonewall's Valley Campaign (as well as some of his other exploits), it seems that his ability to lean on his faith for focus largely served as an asset.   However, it is important to recognize that it was an asset only because he managed to use it to the right effect.   His ability to relegate emotions and worries about things outside his control into a mental bucket labeled \"In the hands of providence - Not worth further anxiety or second guessing\" cleared up more space for his skills as a leader, analytical mind and tactical genius to use up more mental bandwidth.   Unquestionable faith in a bronze age deity comes with a host of risks and downsides and, in the minds of a lesser general, it could just as easily have been used to rationalize hesitation or retreat.   Furthermore, it is generally dangerous to abandon reason and logic in one department of one's mind, as it may become difficult to prevent the tumor from spreading.\n\nThe best strategy is without question to invest in scientific and technological advancement, training, education, and any other possible preparation that can help you avoid finding yourself in a strategically inferior position with limited information like that of Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley.   It's not hard to imagine that Stonewall himself would choose having superior forces over being left to rely on his \"two rules\" in the face of an overwhelming enemy force.   The United States military has become famously good at managing the odds over the course of the last 70 years.   In fact, most modern American military leaders have never experienced a battle in which the US lacked clear superiority.   But what if that wasn't always going to be the case?   What if a conflict arises in which the opening blows involve the destruction of satellite communication and GPS networks?   Might we learn from Jackson's greatest victory to aid us in such a scenario?\n\nWhile I would strongly advise against resorting to faith in a religion like Jackson's, I do believe there is a lesson to be gleaned from his example that can benefit the modern educated atheist.  I would suggest the addition of the following to Jackson's \"two rules\" that we discussed previously:\n\n> _When facing heavy odds, limited information and lacking the benefit of being able to delay taking action, it is preferable to be able to quickly distinguish between what is within ones control and to avoid the mental fog that can be caused by letting emotions (e.g. guilt, fear, etc.) run rampant.   A leader should take every possible step to gather the best available information and then take decisive action and remain ready to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and new data._\n\nYou might reply by saying, \"Easier said than done!\", and I would have to agree.   However, there are non-secular methods that can help.   One of the best that I have encountered is to develop the skill of mindfulness.   For some, this can be achieved via a regular meditation practice.  If you have not already explored the field of meditation and mindfulness, I would highly recommend Sam Harris' \"Waking Up\" app along with his book of the same title as useful resources.   Mindfulness is a tool that, if mastered, can allow you to protect yourself from the mental fog caused by swirling emotions in the face of stress or pressure.   \n\nIn addition to mindfulness, I contend that one can replace Jackson's blind faith in a Christian God with a firm faith in reason and logic.   \"Never take counsel of your fears,\" as Jackson said.  Be certain that the future is uncertain, that you will likely be faced with unexpected developments and new challenges and, when they arise, be prepared to use reason and logic to take the next decisive action based on the best information you have available.  \n\nFinally, we should strive to ensure that all of our leaders are clear on their objectives and that they are empowered to operate in accordance with their best judgement when it isn't possible to be in constant contact with superiors.   Lee (and J. Johnston) followed these principles when giving their orders to Jackson and were greatly rewarded.   \n\n\n## Postscript\n\nPersonally, I suspect that there is a great deal to be gained via a better understanding of the concept of \"free will\" and the contention that it is likely to be an illusion.   It seems relevant when discussing the topic in this essay.   As discussed above, I suspect that Stonewall was using his religious faith as a tool to help him more clearly differentiate between what he could and couldn't control and thereby optimizing his ability to process information and make decisions.   The idea that we may lack the \"free will\" to consciously choose which actions we will take is one that could have profoundly important implications, including when it comes to how we conduct ourselves under pressure.

While much has been written of the detailed events of the campaign, Jackson's eccentricities, religious fanaticism, and the genius of his military tactics, I find it interesting to explore the interplay and relative importance of his religious beliefs and the conduct of tactics that ultimately won the day.  In this essay I will argue that, while his success in the Valley Campaign was the result of a number of different factors, it would not have been possible without his religious fanaticism.  His absolute faith provided him with a construct that allowed him to partition his thinking by drawing clear boundaries between what was within his control vs. what was outside of it, thereby removing a need for the types of doubt and second guessing that litter the histories of the blunders of other Civil War generals.`},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\",lineNumber:12,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"Finally, I will discuss what I think may be alternative methods that modern leaders might leverage to achieve the type of focus and freedom from emotion that Stonewall wielded, but without having to resort to a blind faith in a first century carpenter.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\",lineNumber:14,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.h2,{id:\"background-for-valley-campaign\",children:[(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#background-for-valley-campaign\",children:(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.span,{className:\"icon icon-link\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\"},this),\"Background for Valley Campaign\"]},void 0,!0,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\",lineNumber:16,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:`The backdrop for Jackson's Valley Campaign was General George McClellan's famous \"Peninsula Campaign\", in which the latter ferried over 100,000 soldiers down the Potomac to Hampton Roads and moved up the peninsula with the aim of taking Richmond.   McClellan vastly outnumbered Joseph Johnston's (and eventually Robert E. Lee's) forced defending the Confederate capitol.  Jackson was initially dispatched to the Shenandoah Valley in late 1861 due to it's strategic importance to the Confederacy due to it's abundance of much needed livestock and agricultural supplies.   However, his campaign there in Spring 1862 was ultimately significant for the diversion it created to keep Federal troops from being able to join McClellan's outside Richmond during his Peninsula Campaign.   As an advisor to Jefferson Davis at the time, Robert E. Lee saw the threat of Gen. Irwin McDowell joining Gen. George McClellan and conveyed the situation to Jackson and told him the potential benefit to the broader military situation if he could present a threat to Washington, DC near Harpers Ferry.  Jackson eventually gathered a force of around ~17,000 men compared to a total of around 52,000 that eventually opposed him in the Shenandoah Valley under Banks, Fremont and McDowell.  Over the course of just 48 days, Jackson forced his men to march a blistering 646 miles, typically under detailed instructions to march for 50 minutes out of each hour and to spend the other ten minutes prone to maximize resting.  He seems to have personally slept rarely, moving with his men by day and studying his detailed maps at night in order to constantly adapt his strategy.   He outwitted and surprised his numerically superior opponents on multiple occasions and ultimately won several minor battles, capturing hundreds of prisoners, large amounts of supplies and completely routing Nathaniel Banks' army and sending it's soldiers fleeing back across the Potomac towards D.C.   The ultimate result was exactly what Lee had hoped for and, by occupying McDowell in the north, Jackson prevented him from reinforcing McClellan and may well have saved Richmond from falling less than two years into the war.   Abraham Lincoln himself is known to have been acutely aware of Jackson's skill in the Valley Campaign, as he was personally involved in developing Federal plans to counter him.`},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\",lineNumber:18,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.h2,{id:\"the-plight-of-a-civil-war-general\",children:[(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#the-plight-of-a-civil-war-general\",children:(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.span,{className:\"icon icon-link\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\"},this),\"The Plight of a Civil War General\"]},void 0,!0,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-043baa92-2585-4f2b-b33b-12070f4cec0d.mdx\",lineNumber:21,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,t.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"If one is to study the exploits of Civil War generals with an aim of learning lessons about what makes for a successful military leader and tactician, it seems relevant to consider just how different the situation was for Civil War generals relative to modern military leaders.

The Northern and Southern governments certainly did what they could to cultivate intelligence sources, but even at its best it was far more limited than what todays leaders often have to rely on.   There was no satellite surveillance or GPS navigation.   When maps were available, they were not always current or accurate.

Once they were engaged, they could expect significant latency if they needed to get in touch with their superiors, if such communication was even possible at all.   For Jackson during the Valley Campaign, he would typically have been days away from reinforcements as well as days from being able to get a message to Richmond, let alone to then get a response.   In the midst of a battle, generals like Jackson were often severely limited in their ability to comprehend the status of their full command due to the simple constraints of line of sight and delays in communication.   For example, during the peninsula campaign McClellan was sometimes known to have personally climbed a tree with the hope of getting a better vantage point.

His ability to relegate emotions and worries about things outside his control into a mental bucket labeled \"In the hands of providence - Not worth further anxiety or second guessing\" cleared up more space for his skills as a leader, analytical mind and tactical genius to use up more mental bandwidth.   Unquestionable faith in a bronze age deity comes with a host of risks and downsides and, in the minds of a lesser general, it could just as easily have been used to rationalize hesitation or retreat.

      "raw": "\nI haven't owned a TV in years.  The main reason for getting out of the business of owning a TV was because I don't like the idea of having a whole room in my house oriented around watching TV.  Not having a TV around forces you to really be present when you have guests and to spend more time talking together instead of just silently plugging into a screen together.  I have found that I do still watch more content on my laptop after getting rid of a TV, but net-net I spend less time doing so.  I also no longer waste any time turning on the TV and rewatching the same mediocre movie and commercials that FX is playing (they've \"got the movies\") or reruns of some dumb show on USA (Characters welcome).  Finally, a few years back I resolved to never pay Comcast any more money for the rest of my life and not having a TV makes it even easier to achieve that goal.  \n\nAnother great argument for no longer needing to pay Comcast any of your hard-earned money is that Youtube is a gold mine of content that allows you to curate your own personal replacement for traditional cable packages, but with far more flexbility to fine tune it to just the content you're interested in.  I highly recommend paying for Youtube Red so you can avoid any commericals or ads, as well.  \n\nHere are some of my recommendations for channels to consider following:\n\n### Music Channels:\n- [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/c/RickBeato_)\n- [Vulfpeck’s channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DJparadiddle)\n- [Jim Lill](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimLill45)\n- [Polyphonic](https://www.youtube.com/c/Polyphonic) - excellent content on music history and approachable explanations of music theory.\n- [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamNeely) - Similar to Rick Beato's channel in terms of the type of content.  Best suited for intermediate+ musicians. \n\n### Science & Engineering:\n- [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars) - This channel is a must-follow, even though I have to warn you that Mark Rober's voice is super annoying. \n- [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/PracticalEngineeringChannel) - mostly civil engineering stuff but this guy does a great job of making civil engineering interesting and teaching you about how the infrastucture we depend on and take for granted actually works. \n- [Backyard Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBackyardScientist)\n- [Periodic table of videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos) - a chemistry channel wooo!\n- [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/c/smartereveryday) - one of my all time favorites.\n- [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium)\n\n### Misc Learning:\n- [Primitive Skills](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimitiveSkillsnet) - I've been following this one for a long time.   Be sure to turn subtitles on.  It is fascinating to learn how iron-age humans built tools and primitive infrastucture.  This guy somewhere in Southeast Asia who shows how you can live with Iron Age technology.  It's also a super peaceful nature soundtrack throughout so a good show to fall asleep watching.  \n- [BamaBass](https://www.youtube.com/c/BamaBassOfficial)\n\n### Extreme Sports:\n- Obviously you gotta have my friend Scott Sappenfield's channel so you can watch him get progressively better (and more daring) at Mountain Biking: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottSappenfield\n- Dane Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaneJackson) - Some of the best content out there when it comes to extreme whitewater kayaking.\n- [Nathan Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkKS3xsYLdo&t=805s) - One of my favorites for great surf footage mixed with actually helpful instruction, especially if you're interested in big wave skills.",

      "raw": "\nI find Vietnam War history to be fascinating to study for a number of reasons.  It is riddled with irony, tradgedy, heroism (on both sides) and you end up learning so much about the soul of America by studying it.  I was recently pondering the following: What if instead of fighting the Vietnam war, the US had spent the money we spent on war on a lump-sum payment to the people of N. Vietnam as a sort of bribe to achieve its desired outcome without a horrific war.  \n\nObviously this alternate scenario could not have happened for many reasons, such as:\n- Leaders on neither side had an accurate understanding of how dark the war would get until several yars into the conflict\n- It's possible, if not likely, that the ideological power of socialism/communism at the time would have been too strong\n- The US leaders wouldn't have had a good means for calculating the amount to offer given the lack of visibility into the path the war would take in terms of lives lost and financial costs.\n\nHowever, I still think it's an interesting thought experiment with potential lessons to consider as we face future threats of conflict.  The threat of a conflict between the U.S. and China is especially relevant given that the magnitude of potential financial impacts are staggering.\n\nAlright, let's run the numbers.   In 1968, the population of the North was ~18.7 million.   The true cost of the war is a bit tricky to fully calculate, but for the sake of this thought experiment, let's go with an estimate from a [NYTimes article published in 1975](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/01/archives/us-spent-141billion-in-vietnam-in-14-years.html) that put the cost at $141B spent from 1961 through surrender.  That's about $7,450 per citizen of the north.  \n\nLet's say we dropped pamphlets all over the countryside to announce to the North Korean populace that we would give each citizen of North Vietnam $7,450 if the North:\n- Switched to our political system and adopted capitalism and a representative democracy\n- We'd optionally offer them a favorable trade partnership \n- We'd invest an additional $10B in their school system and other public works needed to pull off the transition at the government level.\n\nThe money for individuals would be held in escrow by the UN until a multi-lateral commission from the UN validated that the criteria had been met and then it would start paying out in the form of five annual cash payments.  You'd also need to come up with a creative way to do the payouts that would limit the risk of fraud and government officials embezzling the money.   \n\nAdjusting for inflation, that $7,450 would be the equivalent of $42,570 in December 2022 terms.   According to [the World Bank](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2022/11/23/vietnam-gdp-per-capita-a-full-breakdown/?sh=2bcff5df111b), the 2021 per capita income in Vietnam was $3,694.02.   So, in today's dollars and assuming today's per capita income, you'd be talking about giving each N. Vietnam citizen 11.5 years of income.   It's probably safe to assume the per capita income was vastly, vastly, vastly lower.  \n\nRegarding the cost estimates, that $141B is just accounting for military expenditures.   That includes things like soldiers' compensation, helicopters, bullets, bombs, fuel for ships and planes, etc.   It does not include additional expenses for things like the opportunity cost of what else we could have done with that money, the cost to our government, the foreign aid we had to dump into South Vietnam over the course of the war, etc.   It also doesn't include an estimate for the cost associated with almost 60k American soldiers being taken out of the workforce.  \n\n<Box display=\"flex\" maxWidth=\"lg\" sx={{alignContent: 'center', justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n    <Image\n    src=\"/images/hamburger_hill.png\"\n    alt=\"'Reaching Out' by Larry Burrows\"\n    width={400}\n    height={300}\n    caption=\"'Reaching Out' by Larry Burrows.

    "description": "My reflections after reading 'Alexander Hamilton' by Ron Chernow",
    "thumbnailImage": "/images/alexander-hamilton.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nI recently read Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton and have been fascinated by the parallels between the rise of political factions during Washington’s first two terms and our current divisive political environment.  I also regret to say that I am learning that I haven’t always had a full picture of Thomas Jefferson, who I’ve always held in only the highest esteem.  In order to distill my thoughts, I am going to attempt to write them down.  In this essay, I will do my best to compare and contrast the early Republican Party that formed in Washington’s first two terms as President and the Republican Party of Donald Trump that we have today.   I will then attempt to distill my thoughts on a question I’ve been pondering for the last few years about whether I can distill the nature and motives of the Democratic and Republican ideologies down to their most basic principles.  \n\n<Box display=\"flex\" maxWidth=\"lg\" sx={{alignContent: 'center', justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n    <Image\n    src=\"/images/alexander-hamilton.png\"\n    alt=\"Alexander Hamilton\"\n    width={300}\n    height={400}\n    caption=\"Alexander Hamilton, oil on canvas by John Trumbull, c. 1792; in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\"\n    style= {{ objectFit: 'cover'}}\n    />\n</Box>\n\nFirst of all, it seems clear that Alexander Hamilton was a true genius and, apart from some notable but infrequent lapses during his heyday, generally a man of uncommon moral fiber and noble principles.  I think he has been under-appreciated in the teaching of American history, or at least in the version of American history that I was taught and that I know to be taught in much of the American South.  I imagine that this is partly a function of his enemies outliving him and rising to the heights of power after his death.  I do remember when I learned about him back in middle school.  I remember thinking similar thoughts then.  That it seemed to me that his impact on the founding of our nation was among the most important and that I was surprised that he was not depicted more prominently.   However, I also wonder if under-appreciation for Hamilton is to some extent a result of his opposition to Jefferson, Madison, and the descendant political faction that has maintained a powerful role in American society all the way to today’s Republican Party, and that has influenced the way that our history has been written.\n\nThat said, the first topic I sat down to write about today is the parallels between Thomas Jefferson’s Republican Party and the one we have today.   I was fascinated to learn that Jefferson and Madison seem to have also adopted a strategy of distributing misinformation, logically dubious and often unfair claims in order to achieve their goals.  Examples include:\n- Consistently reinforcing statements that Hamilton was a “monarchist” who was part of a secret cabal to overthrow the new US government and replace it with a monarchy.   They clearly must have known that wasn’t actually true given how well they knew Hamilton and how intelligent they clearly were.   On their intelligence, I’ll take it for granted that James Madison, for example, was also a man of uncommon intelligence given the fact that he is the foremost architect of the Constitution.  \n- Downplaying Hamilton’s bout with Yellow Fever and accusing him of faking it when he just had a common cold.  And questioning his bravery even though they knew his reputation in the Revolutionary War.  \n- They also frequently engaged with or employed morally dubious characters to do their dirty work.   Jefferson’s hiring of Phillip Freneau or his meetings with questionable characters in order to dig up dirt on Hamilton remind me somewhat of Trump’s use of Roger Stone or Alex Jones.  \n\nChernow also recounts examples of Jefferson’s hypocrisy that also strikes me as a parallel to examples I see in today’s Republican Party.   Jefferson had no reservations about accusing Hamilton of cowardice even though he didn’t fight in the revolution and demonstrated cowardice when serving as governor of VA.   I’m reminded of the recent notable example of Trump disparaging John McCain, despite having avoided serving in the military by manufacturing a case of “bone spurs”.   It pains me to learn these things about Jefferson.  As a Virginian and as an alum of the University of Virginia (“Mr. Jefferson’s University”), I’ve always idolized him as the writer of the Declaration of Independence, a founding father, a statesman and a polymath.   All of those things are true.  However, I hated to learn that Jefferson’s behavior during his tenure as Secretary of State sometimes bordered on treason.  For example, his clandestine discussions with the French emissary, Edmond-Charles Genêt after the French Revolution, in which he undermined George Washington and colluded with the emissary to help achieve France’s goals despite the fact that Washington and Hamilton would oppose them.  This story bears similarities to treasonous actions of several members of Trump’s administration or those of Nixon when he went around LBJ to communicate with the South Vietnamese government while he was running for president.  \n\nAnother parallel is the fervent belief that many of the Republican-identifying populace has in the fact that the Federalist or Democratic parties were going to doom America.   I do believe that many of the Republican “Trumpers” I know today do truly believe that the opposition will “ruin America”, even though they often aren’t actually able to articulate what that would even mean or look like.  In my opinion, this was much more understandable for the early Republicans.  The “American Experiment” was by no means sure to succeed in the early days.  They were also venturing through relatively uncharted waters given that many aspects of the American system were completely novel, the country had many notable weaknesses and there weren’t other variants of western democracies to compare and contrast against.  I also am inclined to believe that early Republican leaders like Madison and Jefferson also most likely truly believed that the objectives of Hamilton and the Federalists were a real threat to America and that their opposition to them was in the best interests of the nation.  I do not think that is the case in today’s Republican Party.  As I’ll explain later in this essay, I think many of the leaders of the Republican Party have entirely different and mostly selfish motives that they hide behind claims that they are trying to stop Democrats from ruining the country.  \n\nI previously considered listing the early Republican leaders’ respect for decorum, chivalry, and respect as a contrast to today’s republican leaders.  However, upon further reflection I’ve decided that I see parallels in addition to differences in that regard.   They certainly did speak and write more eloquently and they took care to publicly present themselves as honorable and respectful.   Jefferson took great care to use proxies to publish his disparagement of Hamilton and Madison used a pen name when doing so.  Contemporary Republican leaders like Trump, Lindsey Graham, or Sarah Palin, on the other hand, have no reservations about publicly disparaging their opponents both on the merits of their ideas and with typically false representations of their character or motives.   However, the similarity I see is in a willingness to stoop to playing dirty, using misinformation, or suspending logic in their arguments.  Jefferson’s Republicans may have disguised it better behind eloquence, chivalry or proxies, but the theme appears nonetheless.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are also certainly clear contrasts between the early Republican leaders and that of today.  I do think is worthwhile to recognize some here.  The first, and perhaps most obvious, difference is that the early Republican leaders like Madison and Jefferson were truly brilliant.   They were learned, well read and did a great deal to promote education and learning in the early days of the nation.  Madison, for example, founded James Madison University, which is located just over the Blue Ridge Mountains from the University of Virginia.  Both were eloquent and brilliant.   Jefferson was a polymath who was a self taught architect and inventor.   Madison was the primary architect of the Constitution.   Their uncommon intelligence cannot be in doubt.\n\nI also strongly believe that it’s important to appreciate the distinction between thematic similarities and the proportionality or degree to which a theme was perpetrated.  For example, kicking someone in the knee and shooting someone in the chest may both be examples of trying to injure an adversary, but they are vastly different in significance and their moral implications.  With that in mind, I think it’s worth pointing out that there is generally a wide disparity in the degree to which to which Jeffersonian republicans and Trump era Republicans perpetrate the behaviors noted above as common themes.  For example, while I think that it was technically treasonous for Jefferson to undermine Washington in his private meetings with Genet, I think it’s important to note that those actions were not in the same league of treason as Trump’s efforts to overthrow our Democracy on January 6th, 2021.   \n\nIn summary, I’d like to state emphatically my opinion that, when it comes to the merits of their character, accomplishments, intelligence, and their contributions to the founding of our nation, they are, in my opinion, vastly different from the likes of Trump, Sarah Palin, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Newt Gingrich, or Kevin McCarthy.  I have found it thought provoking to analyze the commonalities between the early right-wing faction and today’s in order to better understand the true nature of and motivations of the right, \n\nAs mentioned at the outset of this essay, I’ve been thinking for a while now about whether I could write an essay that managed to provide a simplified characterization of the Democratic and Republican parties.   From my own experience, I’ve seen how hard it can be to see through the external noise and arrive at your own judgements.  In fact, it took me until my mid-20s or even 30s to finally develop my own truly clear opinions about the Republican Party.   Previously they had always been influenced at all levels by the way I was taught American history and by the views of my parents and grandparents.   It seems to me that a lot of Americans struggle to see the true nature of the two parties as well.  I think that is due to a few reasons:\n- It’s difficult to see through the political slogans, propaganda and hype.   This is understandable, as the political narratives and marketing are explicitly designed for that purpose.   For example, Republicans labeling their abortion stance as “Pro Life”, gives a member of the opposite side the challenge of establishing that they are not “pro death” in addition to or before arguing the merits of their views on abortion, which is a much more nuanced and complicated topic than their black and white analogy to life or death would imply.  \n- The system itself gives a certain amount of gravity and respect to the either party on the basis of tradition.  The need for decorum and some degree of mutual respect in order for the system to function well also skews the left into having to perhaps demonstrate more respect for republican opponents than they deserve.\n- I am not a psychologist, but I tend to observe that we as humans have a cognitive deficiency when it comes to recognizing, remembering, and accounting for proportionality in our minds.   For example, you might see a contemporary Republican make an argument like, “You say that Democrats are honest and Trump is lying.  Well, what about when Clinton lied about Monica Lewinsky?  There are liars on both sides so why should I trust what Biden or Obama says is true?”\n\nOver the last eight years or so, I’ve managed to sort through those fingerprints of propaganda and my childhood education on my own conscious and subconscious feelings about our history and politics.  I’ve increasingly found myself having moments of clarity during which I found myself thinking “wait a minute?  Am I the only one who really sees what the modern Republican ideology really is at its most basic level?!”   It will of course be necessary to justify my opinions at length and I intend to do so, but I’ll start by stating it plainly that I think the true core motivation for aligning with Republican ideology among the general populace are fear, a generally pessimistic outlook on humanity, and a selfish desire to preserve and accumulate personal wealth.   This leaves that group of people vulnerable to leaders who are willing to exploit those motivations to achieve their primary motivation: power.   Another important variable is education and intelligence.  It seems to be that the more enlightened a citizen is, the more likely they are to move to the political left.   This can be offset in some cases if republican leaders can sufficiently exploit their fear or desire to preserve wealth in order to overcome the leftward pull that comes with education and logic.   \n\nIt seems to me that the Republican or Conservative party in America is set up to favor the wealthy and selfish.   The reality is that most of the people in Trump’s base would be better off voting for Democrats.   They would benefit from universal healthcare, student loan forgiveness, regulation on financial markets and big banks, and definitely from taxes on the wealthy to redistribute wealth back down to poor farmers, coal miners, and the middle class.  But the Republican Party has done a masterful job of marketing and has exhibited a talent for manipulating weaknesses in the human psyche.   For example, they make a big deal out of gun rights.  If they can make that a big enough topic, they can get voters to align with the party of not taxing the uber rich, even if that disadvantages those less wealthy gun owning voters.  Or Trump and others playing on the Christian vote.   If you can get your party associated with “not murdering babies”, you can get people to overlook the fact that you also want to deregulate big industry so you can get away with dumping pollutants into our waterways.   \n\nTo end this essay on a lighter note, I will share that another take-away I’ve had from Chernow’s book is that I really wish I could meet Alexander Hamilton.  He’s someone I would greatly like to have intellectual discussions with, to learn from, and likely would enjoy having as a friend.  \n",

For example, his clandestine discussions with the French emissary, Edmond-Charles Gen\\xEAt after the French Revolution, in which he undermined George Washington and colluded with the emissary to help achieve France\\u2019s goals despite the fact that Washington and Hamilton would oppose them.

      "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nRegardless of how we feel about the cause for which he fought, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was indisputably an excellent military commander.   While he earned his fame by \"standing like a stone wall...with his Virginians\" at First Bull Run and was a key contributor to the more famous and numerically larger victory at Chancellorsville, perhaps his greatest achievement as a military leader was his performance during his 1862 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley.   While much has been written of the detailed events of the campaign, Jackson's eccentricities, religious fanaticism, and the genius of his military tactics, I find it interesting to explore the interplay and relative importance of his religious beliefs and the conduct of tactics that ultimately won the day.  In this essay I will argue that, while his success in the Valley Campaign was the result of a number of different factors, it would not have been possible without his religious fanaticism.  His absolute faith provided him with a construct that allowed him to partition his thinking by drawing clear boundaries between what was within his control vs. what was outside of it, thereby removing a need for the types of doubt and second guessing that litter the histories of the blunders of other Civil War generals.  \n\nFinally, I will discuss what I think may be alternative methods that modern leaders might leverage to achieve the type of focus and freedom from emotion that Stonewall wielded, but without having to resort to a blind faith in a first century carpenter.\n\n<Box display=\"flex\" maxWidth=\"lg\" sx={{alignContent: 'center', justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n    <Image\n    src=\"/images/prayer-stonewalls-camp.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Soldiers praying together in Stonewall Jackson's camp.\"\n    width={400}\n    height={300}\n    caption=\"Prayer in Stonewall Jackson's camp / drawn by P. Kramer, engraved by J.C. Buttre.\"\n    style= {{ objectFit: 'cover'}}\n    />\n</Box>\n\n## Background for Valley Campaign\n\nThe backdrop for Jackson's Valley Campaign was General George McClellan's famous \"Peninsula Campaign\", in which the latter ferried over 100,000 soldiers down the Potomac to Hampton Roads and moved up the peninsula with the aim of taking Richmond.   McClellan vastly outnumbered Joseph Johnston's (and eventually Robert E. Lee's) forced defending the Confederate capitol.  Jackson was initially dispatched to the Shenandoah Valley in late 1861 due to it's strategic importance to the Confederacy due to it's abundance of much needed livestock and agricultural supplies.   However, his campaign there in Spring 1862 was ultimately significant for the diversion it created to keep Federal troops from being able to join McClellan's outside Richmond during his Peninsula Campaign.   As an advisor to Jefferson Davis at the time, Robert E. Lee saw the threat of Gen. Irwin McDowell joining Gen. George McClellan and conveyed the situation to Jackson and told him the potential benefit to the broader military situation if he could present a threat to Washington, DC near Harpers Ferry.  Jackson eventually gathered a force of around ~17,000 men compared to a total of around 52,000 that eventually opposed him in the Shenandoah Valley under Banks, Fremont and McDowell.  Over the course of just 48 days, Jackson forced his men to march a blistering 646 miles, typically under detailed instructions to march for 50 minutes out of each hour and to spend the other ten minutes prone to maximize resting.  He seems to have personally slept rarely, moving with his men by day and studying his detailed maps at night in order to constantly adapt his strategy.   He outwitted and surprised his numerically superior opponents on multiple occasions and ultimately won several minor battles, capturing hundreds of prisoners, large amounts of supplies and completely routing Nathaniel Banks' army and sending it's soldiers fleeing back across the Potomac towards D.C.   The ultimate result was exactly what Lee had hoped for and, by occupying McDowell in the north, Jackson prevented him from reinforcing McClellan and may well have saved Richmond from falling less than two years into the war.   Abraham Lincoln himself is known to have been acutely aware of Jackson's skill in the Valley Campaign, as he was personally involved in developing Federal plans to counter him.\n\n\n## The Plight of a Civil War General\n\nIf one is to study the exploits of Civil War generals with an aim of learning lessons about what makes for a successful military leader and tactician, it seems relevant to consider just how different the situation was for Civil War generals relative to modern military leaders.   In particular, the typical Civil War general had to operate with far more limited communication abilities and vastly more limited intelligence sources, both in quantity and quality.   The Northern and Southern governments certainly did what they could to cultivate intelligence sources, but even at its best it was far more limited than what todays leaders often have to rely on.   There was no satellite surveillance or GPS navigation.   When maps were available, they were not always current or accurate.   Even when an informant arrived claiming to have personally witnessed an enemy movement or position, they lacked what we now consider a the simple technological miracle of being able to see proof of this report in the form of photographic evidence taken with a smartphone.  \n\nThey also often lacked the benefit of immediate bi-directional communication with their superiors, peers or supporting elements.   On the day of a planned assault, one general might be charged with waiting to hear the thunder of distant cannons to judge whether an allied unit had arrived and initiated their own assault, thereby indicating that their own attack should commence.  Once they were engaged, they could expect significant latency if they needed to get in touch with their superiors, if such communication was even possible at all.   For Jackson during the Valley Campaign, he would typically have been days away from reinforcements as well as days from being able to get a message to Richmond, let alone to then get a response.   In the midst of a battle, generals like Jackson were often severely limited in their ability to comprehend the status of their full command due to the simple constraints of line of sight and delays in communication.   For example, during the peninsula campaign McClellan was sometimes known to have personally climbed a tree with the hope of getting a better vantage point.   The constant dearth of basic battlefield intelligence was, in fact, what ultimately led to Stonewall's death at Fredericksburg -- with the desire to mount a night attack and finish off the union forces, he rode out beyond the lines with his staff officers to personally scout for a night attack and was shot down by nervous Confederate pickets who mistook his party for the enemy when they returned to the lines.  \n\nAn obvious effect of the lonely nature of being a Civil War general was the rollercoaster of disastrous defeats and heroic victories that makes studying the war so entertaining for many students and historians.   However, I find this dynamic makes for an especially interesting opportunity for a focused study of how specific individuals performed under adversity and in a communication vacuum.   Unlike today's leaders who can always rely on making a satellite or radio call to allies, superiors, or advisors, Jackson's isolation shines a spotlight on how his individual beliefs, attributes and personality contributed to battlefield outcomes.  \n\n\n## About Jackson\n\nIn the interest of brevity, I will refrain from providing extensive biographical information about Stonewall Jackson.   For those who are not already familiar with him, I highly recommend reading Shelby Foote's masterpiece or watching Ken Burns' documentary \"The Civil War\".   Or, if you're short on time, check out [the wikipedia page on him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson).   However, it is important to note some key facts about him.   First and potentially foremost, he was a religious fanatic.   His beliefs were present in everything he did--the way he communicated to his superiors and his men, the way he fought his battles (and when he fought them), and his attitude towards death and killing.  They even influenced the way he died, when he refused to take brandy for the pain when he lay dying from pneumonia after the amputation of his arm, saying that he wanted to keep his mind clear for when he went to meet the lord.   When his wife and doctor informed him that he would die that day, he replied \"Very good, very good.  I always wanted to die on a Sunday.\"  \n\nHe was a trained soldier and military leader, having graduated from West Point and working as a teacher at the Virginia Military Institute prior to the war, but his military exploits were far from being \"by the book\".   He was daring and versatile, remaining calm in the face of opportunity and dire threat, whether that threat was of being surrounded by adversaries or personally standing like \"a stone wall\" in the face of enemy fire.  He was ruthless towards the enemy and saw the killing of his opponents in a way that seems to have been purely tactical and non-emotional.   He was also rarely known to react emotionally to the deaths of his own men, although he was acutely aware of his need to preserve as many of his limited forces as possible for tactical and strategic value.\n\n\n## The Ingredients in Jackson's Recipe for Success\n\nBy his own account, Jackson would surely have listed \"God's blessing\" as the primary cause of his success, as he did shortly after the fact in writing to his wife that \"God has been our shield and to his name be all the glory.\"   While he was keen to give the credit to \"divine providence\", he was also brilliantly capable of distilling some of the core tactical and strategic \"rules\" that he had employed in achieving the outcome that \"providence\" had given him.   He said the following to one of his adjutants:\n\n\n> _Always mystify, mislead and surprise your enemy.  And when you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as your men have strength to follow, for an army routed, if hotly pursued, becomes panic stricken and can then be destroyed by half their number.  The other rule is never fight against heavy odds if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your own force on only a part—and at the weakest part—of your enemy and crush it.  Such tactics will win every time and a small army will thus destroy a large one in detail and repeated victory will make it invincible._\n\n\nJackson's rules could certainly fit right into a textbook on sound military doctrine.   However, these rules were not exactly foreign to many other Civil War leaders on both sides.   It's hard to imagine McClellan or Grant choosing an alternate approach if faced with similarly inferior numbers.   What's more interesting to me is what allowed him to stay focused on a day-to-day basis and avoid the tendency for second guessing that so famously plagued other generals like McClellan or Jackson's opponent at Chancellorsville, Joe Hooker, who after the battle admitted that he had \"lost confidence in Joe Hooker\".   \n\nBeyond the military principals found in Jackson's rules above, there were a number of other factors that, if missing, could have changed the outcome of the campaign.   \n\n### 1. His confidence and ability to take risks with conviction and no hesitation   \n  \n  It's one thing to believe in your heart that you need to \"mystify, mislead and surprise your enemy\".   It's another to pull it off, especially when operating in a communication vacuum with limited intelligence.\n  \n### 2. His ability to push his men beyond what more compassionate generals might have considered to be their limit   \n  \n  Out of necessity, Jackson pushed his men to march unusually hard and long in order to out-maneuver and surprise his opponents.   So much so that they began to be referred to as \"Jackson's foot cavalry\".   He kept a cool aloofness from the rank and file, showing no sympathy for men who collapsed from exhaustion.   When told that a runner had died from enemy fire when delivering a message for him, he simply replied \"very commendable, very commendable\", and calmly moved on with what he was doing.   This degree of cold, emotionless leadership was far from the norm among Civil War generals.   Lee often appealed to emotion and the deep love his men developed for him.   McClellan told his troops he saw it as his duty to look after them like a parent.  Grant perhaps came closer during his Overland Campaign in 1864, but he was known to be capable of deep remorse and emotion at the loss of his men.\n\n### 3. His own personal endurance  \n\n He doesn’t seem to have been much for sleeping.   I suspect he had an ability to not sleep much and instead be able to stay up studying his detailed maps and hatching plans.  \n\n### 4. A healthy dose of luck, coupled with an eye for recognizing opportunities and a presence of mind to move quickly to exploit them  \n\nYes, there certainly were lots of lucky moments and events.   Some include well timed rainstorms and hailstorms.    These presented a variety of benefits, such as swelling rivers but also being so extreme that any normal general would consider them a reason to halt a column.  But not Jackson.  He saw the “hail the size of a hens egg” as a blessing that would allow him to push his men to take the literal bruises and march through it while the enemy hesitated.  \n\n### 5. His ability to have no hesitation when it came to killing the enemy  \n\n He was clear minded and untroubled by his conviction that his objective was to destroy them.   I suspect his religious views served a purpose here as well.  It must have been a mechanism that let him simply put sympathy and hesitation out of his mind.  At one point during the Valley Campaign, one of his subordinates reported having successfully defended against a cavalry charge but stated that it was a shame to have killed Union troops who had demonstrated such bravery.  Jackson reproached him, making it clear that that he wanted as many dead as possible so there would be that many fewer to fight him next time.\n \n### 6. A genuine love of battle that was unmitigated by emotions like fear and sadness\n\n It does also seem relevant that he genuinely seems to have loved battle.  I suspect he liked the adrenaline rush and accompanying mental focus.  However, his religious fervor once again seems likely to have been relevant here as well.   For most people, the thrill of battle is balanced by other emotions such as confusion and a horrible fear of injury or death.   Jackson had complete faith that there was nothing to fear about the Heaven that awaited him, leaving him to bask in the adrenaline high of combat. \n\nCredit for his successes has often been attributed, in part, to the fact that he had large, detailed and extremely accurate maps of the theater that his opponents did not have access to.  For example, Ken Burns and Shelby Foote both note this in their respective histories on the subject.   However, I have not included this factor in the list above because it's not clear to me that he would have failed if he had only had somewhat less detailed maps.   It seems possible that he could have compensated for shortcomings of inferior maps either by leaning on his resourcefulness, quick thinking, and the likely presence of Virginian soldiers in his force who knew the terrain.\n\n## The Role of Jackson's Religious Fervor\n\nIn addition to the list of factors documented above, I would argue that his deeply held religious views were also a factor that contributed to his success.   Furthermore, I would argue that, while his intelligence, tactical brilliance, famously excellent maps, and luck were all necessary factors, they may not have been enough without adding his religious fanaticism.   Were he alive today, I could imagine that Jackson himself would claim to see \"the hand of God\" in each of the other factors.  \n\nI suspect it let him have the mental safety to let go of things outside his control by telling himself they were up to the almighty.   That way he’s able to take risks without constant second guessing himself and gave him an ever-at-hand defense against emotions like fear or compassion that might cloud his judgement.   It's not difficult to imagine the types of questions that the average person might have struggled with if they found themselves in Jacksons position.   Imagine you had four hours to try and get some sleep between two twenty hour days of marching--on a knife edge between disaster and potential victory.   Might your sleep-deprived, adrenaline soaked brain have spiraled through the plethora of totally reasonable questions on which your plan depended?  \"What if the Fremont and Shields didn't stop marching during the hailstorm either and are closer than I hope?   What if Ewell's troops don't show up in time to allow my plan to come together?   What if hundreds or thousands of my men end up dying if I make the wrong decision?!  How will I ever forgive myself if I make a judgement error that causes the destruction of my command!?\"  It certainly makes it easier to focus on what you can control and on taking decisive action if you can fend off such questions by remembering that those things are \"up to divine providence\" and that, if anything, you'd be insulting God by spending time stressing about them as though you didn't trust him to deliver you to whatever outcome he sees fit.   \n\nHis religious faith would have allowed him to compartmentalize things so he could stay laser focused on what was in his control.   Without this tool, he might not have been able to quickly capitalize on the noteworthy instances of luck that came his way, to ignore the complaints of his exhausted troops (some of whom were literally passing out on the march), and to accomplish so much in 48 short days without getting distracted by the overall dire state of Confederate military affairs at the time.\n\nOne could perhaps question whether my arguments above are assigning too much credit to his religious fervor without any good way to know for sure what really was going on in Jackson's mind.   What if he was just one of those people who don't really get anxiety?   Maybe he was just really good at clearing his mind and focusing?  It is possible that he simply had the type of mind that was exceptionally good at decisive action and immune from emotion and second guessing.   In fact, to some extent that was likely the case regardless of the role of religion.   However, a litany of primary sources make it clear that his religion was one of the things that defined him and was present in almost everything he ever wrote or said.    His was an \"army of the living God\" and he was known to have said that \"my religious belief reaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.\"  Given the degree to which history has documented his Presbyterian fervor, I believe that we can conclude that it was a part of the bedrock of his mental framework.   \n\n\n### So What?  Should we All Become Presbyterians? \n\nIn the case of Stonewall's Valley Campaign (as well as some of his other exploits), it seems that his ability to lean on his faith for focus largely served as an asset.   However, it is important to recognize that it was an asset only because he managed to use it to the right effect.   His ability to relegate emotions and worries about things outside his control into a mental bucket labeled \"In the hands of providence - Not worth further anxiety or second guessing\" cleared up more space for his skills as a leader, analytical mind and tactical genius to use up more mental bandwidth.   Unquestionable faith in a bronze age deity comes with a host of risks and downsides and, in the minds of a lesser general, it could just as easily have been used to rationalize hesitation or retreat.   Furthermore, it is generally dangerous to abandon reason and logic in one department of one's mind, as it may become difficult to prevent the tumor from spreading.\n\nThe best strategy is without question to invest in scientific and technological advancement, training, education, and any other possible preparation that can help you avoid finding yourself in a strategically inferior position with limited information like that of Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley.   It's not hard to imagine that Stonewall himself would choose having superior forces over being left to rely on his \"two rules\" in the face of an overwhelming enemy force.   The United States military has become famously good at managing the odds over the course of the last 70 years.   In fact, most modern American military leaders have never experienced a battle in which the US lacked clear superiority.   But what if that wasn't always going to be the case?   What if a conflict arises in which the opening blows involve the destruction of satellite communication and GPS networks?   Might we learn from Jackson's greatest victory to aid us in such a scenario?\n\nWhile I would strongly advise against resorting to faith in a religion like Jackson's, I do believe there is a lesson to be gleaned from his example that can benefit the modern educated atheist.  I would suggest the addition of the following to Jackson's \"two rules\" that we discussed previously:\n\n> _When facing heavy odds, limited information and lacking the benefit of being able to delay taking action, it is preferable to be able to quickly distinguish between what is within ones control and to avoid the mental fog that can be caused by letting emotions (e.g. guilt, fear, etc.) run rampant.   A leader should take every possible step to gather the best available information and then take decisive action and remain ready to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and new data._\n\nYou might reply by saying, \"Easier said than done!\", and I would have to agree.   However, there are non-secular methods that can help.   One of the best that I have encountered is to develop the skill of mindfulness.   For some, this can be achieved via a regular meditation practice.  If you have not already explored the field of meditation and mindfulness, I would highly recommend Sam Harris' \"Waking Up\" app along with his book of the same title as useful resources.   Mindfulness is a tool that, if mastered, can allow you to protect yourself from the mental fog caused by swirling emotions in the face of stress or pressure.   \n\nIn addition to mindfulness, I contend that one can replace Jackson's blind faith in a Christian God with a firm faith in reason and logic.   \"Never take counsel of your fears,\" as Jackson said.  Be certain that the future is uncertain, that you will likely be faced with unexpected developments and new challenges and, when they arise, be prepared to use reason and logic to take the next decisive action based on the best information you have available.  \n\nFinally, we should strive to ensure that all of our leaders are clear on their objectives and that they are empowered to operate in accordance with their best judgement when it isn't possible to be in constant contact with superiors.   Lee (and J. Johnston) followed these principles when giving their orders to Jackson and were greatly rewarded.   \n\n\n## Postscript\n\nPersonally, I suspect that there is a great deal to be gained via a better understanding of the concept of \"free will\" and the contention that it is likely to be an illusion.   It seems relevant when discussing the topic in this essay.   As discussed above, I suspect that Stonewall was using his religious faith as a tool to help him more clearly differentiate between what he could and couldn't control and thereby optimizing his ability to process information and make decisions.   The idea that we may lack the \"free will\" to consciously choose which actions we will take is one that could have profoundly important implications, including when it comes to how we conduct ourselves under pressure.   In future essays I intend to explore the topic of free will at length, and may well revisit the conclusions drawn here as a result.\n\n\n## References\n\n- James I.

While much has been written of the detailed events of the campaign, Jackson's eccentricities, religious fanaticism, and the genius of his military tactics, I find it interesting to explore the interplay and relative importance of his religious beliefs and the conduct of tactics that ultimately won the day.  In this essay I will argue that, while his success in the Valley Campaign was the result of a number of different factors, it would not have been possible without his religious fanaticism.  His absolute faith provided him with a construct that allowed him to partition his thinking by drawing clear boundaries between what was within his control vs. what was outside of it, thereby removing a need for the types of doubt and second guessing that litter the histories of the blunders of other Civil War generals.`},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\",lineNumber:11,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"Finally, I will discuss what I think may be alternative methods that modern leaders might leverage to achieve the type of focus and freedom from emotion that Stonewall wielded, but without having to resort to a blind faith in a first century carpenter.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\",lineNumber:13,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,a.jsxDEV)(m,{display:\"flex\",maxWidth:\"lg\",sx:{alignContent:\"center\",justifyContent:\"center\"},children:(0,a.jsxDEV)(b,{src:\"/images/prayer-stonewalls-camp.jpg\",alt:\"Soldiers praying together in Stonewall Jackson's camp.\",width:400,height:300,caption:\"Prayer in Stonewall Jackson's camp / drawn by P.

McClellan vastly outnumbered Joseph Johnston's (and eventually Robert E. Lee's) forced defending the Confederate capitol.  Jackson was initially dispatched to the Shenandoah Valley in late 1861 due to it's strategic importance to the Confederacy due to it's abundance of much needed livestock and agricultural supplies.   However, his campaign there in Spring 1862 was ultimately significant for the diversion it created to keep Federal troops from being able to join McClellan's outside Richmond during his Peninsula Campaign.   As an advisor to Jefferson Davis at the time, Robert E. Lee saw the threat of Gen. Irwin McDowell joining Gen. George McClellan and conveyed the situation to Jackson and told him the potential benefit to the broader military situation if he could present a threat to Washington, DC near Harpers Ferry.  Jackson eventually gathered a force of around ~17,000 men compared to a total of around 52,000 that eventually opposed him in the Shenandoah Valley under Banks, Fremont and McDowell.  Over the course of just 48 days, Jackson forced his men to march a blistering 646 miles, typically under detailed instructions to march for 50 minutes out of each hour and to spend the other ten minutes prone to maximize resting.  He seems to have personally slept rarely, moving with his men by day and studying his detailed maps at night in order to constantly adapt his strategy.   He outwitted and surprised his numerically superior opponents on multiple occasions and ultimately won several minor battles, capturing hundreds of prisoners, large amounts of supplies and completely routing Nathaniel Banks' army and sending it's soldiers fleeing back across the Potomac towards D.C.   The ultimate result was exactly what Lee had hoped for and, by occupying McDowell in the north, Jackson prevented him from reinforcing McClellan and may well have saved Richmond from falling less than two years into the war.   Abraham Lincoln himself is known to have been acutely aware of Jackson's skill in the Valley Campaign, as he was personally involved in developing Federal plans to counter him.`},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\",lineNumber:28,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.h2,{id:\"the-plight-of-a-civil-war-general\",children:[(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#the-plight-of-a-civil-war-general\",children:(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.span,{className:\"icon icon-link\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\"},this),\"The Plight of a Civil War General\"]},void 0,!0,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\",lineNumber:31,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"If one is to study the exploits of Civil War generals with an aim of learning lessons about what makes for a successful military leader and tactician, it seems relevant to consider just how different the situation was for Civil War generals relative to modern military leaders.

The Northern and Southern governments certainly did what they could to cultivate intelligence sources, but even at its best it was far more limited than what todays leaders often have to rely on.   There was no satellite surveillance or GPS navigation.   When maps were available, they were not always current or accurate.

Once they were engaged, they could expect significant latency if they needed to get in touch with their superiors, if such communication was even possible at all.   For Jackson during the Valley Campaign, he would typically have been days away from reinforcements as well as days from being able to get a message to Richmond, let alone to then get a response.   In the midst of a battle, generals like Jackson were often severely limited in their ability to comprehend the status of their full command due to the simple constraints of line of sight and delays in communication.   For example, during the peninsula campaign McClellan was sometimes known to have personally climbed a tree with the hope of getting a better vantage point.   The constant dearth of basic battlefield intelligence was, in fact, what ultimately led to Stonewall's death at Fredericksburg -- with the desire to mount a night attack and finish off the union forces, he rode out beyond the lines with his staff officers to personally scout for a night attack and was shot down by nervous Confederate pickets who mistook his party for the enemy when they returned to the lines.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/sam/code/irregular-expressions/content/_blog-posts/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-06e48aa2-9d70-49c4-9574-371caad0c6e7.mdx\",lineNumber:35,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,a.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"An obvious effect of the lonely nature of being a Civil War general was the rollercoaster of disastrous defeats and heroic victories that makes studying the war so entertaining for many students and historians.

      "raw": "\nI haven't owned a TV in years.  The main reason for getting out of the business of owning a TV was because I don't like the idea of having a whole room in my house oriented around watching TV.  Not having a TV around forces you to really be present when you have guests and to spend more time talking together instead of just silently plugging into a screen together.  I have found that I do still watch more content on my laptop after getting rid of a TV, but net-net I spend less time doing so.  I also no longer waste any time turning on the TV and rewatching the same mediocre movie and commercials that FX is playing (they've \"got the movies\") or reruns of some dumb show on USA (Characters welcome).  Finally, a few years back I resolved to never pay Comcast any more money for the rest of my life and not having a TV makes it even easier to achieve that goal.  \n\nAnother great argument for no longer needing to pay Comcast any of your hard-earned money is that Youtube is a gold mine of content that allows you to curate your own personal replacement for traditional cable packages, but with far more flexbility to fine tune it to just the content you're interested in.  I highly recommend paying for Youtube Red so you can avoid any commericals or ads, as well.  \n\nHere are some of my recommendations for channels to consider following:\n\n### Music Channels:\n- [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/c/RickBeato_)\n- [Vulfpeck’s channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DJparadiddle)\n- [Jim Lill](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimLill45)\n- [Polyphonic](https://www.youtube.com/c/Polyphonic) - excellent content on music history and approachable explanations of music theory.\n- [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamNeely) - Similar to Rick Beato's channel in terms of the type of content.  Best suited for intermediate+ musicians. \n\n### Science & Engineering:\n- [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars) - This channel is a must-follow, even though I have to warn you that Mark Rober's voice is super annoying. \n- [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/PracticalEngineeringChannel) - mostly civil engineering stuff but this guy does a great job of making civil engineering interesting and teaching you about how the infrastucture we depend on and take for granted actually works. \n- [Backyard Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBackyardScientist)\n- [Periodic table of videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos) - a chemistry channel wooo!\n- [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/c/smartereveryday) - one of my all time favorites.\n- [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium)\n\n### Misc Learning:\n- [Primitive Skills](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimitiveSkillsnet) - I've been following this one for a long time.   Be sure to turn subtitles on.  It is fascinating to learn how iron-age humans built tools and primitive infrastucture.  This guy somewhere in Southeast Asia who shows how you can live with Iron Age technology.  It's also a super peaceful nature soundtrack throughout so a good show to fall asleep watching.  \n- [BamaBass](https://www.youtube.com/c/BamaBassOfficial)\n\n### Extreme Sports:\n- Obviously you gotta have my friend Scott Sappenfield's channel so you can watch him get progressively better (and more daring) at Mountain Biking: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottSappenfield\n- Dane Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaneJackson) - Some of the best content out there when it comes to extreme whitewater kayaking.\n- [Nathan Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkKS3xsYLdo&t=805s) - One of my favorites for great surf footage mixed with actually helpful instruction, especially if you're interested in big wave skills.",

I have found that I do still watch more content on my laptop after getting rid of a TV, but net-net I spend less time doing so.  I also no longer waste any time turning on the TV and rewatching the same mediocre movie and commercials that FX is playing (they've \"got the movies\") or reruns of some dumb show on USA (Characters welcome).
