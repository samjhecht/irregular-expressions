# Irregular Expressions with NextJs and Typescript

# TODO:
- go back to using next/image to improve loading optimization
- database for login
- roll my own aggregation feed that has a card for every poem, essay, or instagram post (and source them from insta)
- clean up duplicate and unused images in static/images
- Add integration with instagram client
- add page somewhere about how this site is built.   maybe make it a blog post and then just link to that from the "About" page.
