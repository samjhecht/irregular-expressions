  Just one week 📅 Seven measly days over in the blink of an eye 👁 But oh how I
  know And you should beware: For every seven days Seven measly days There’s
  always six lurking nights Six long lonely nights. They might be nothing Or
  they could just be a dream They could be six parties 🎉 But they could be a
  prison With bars of sunshine 🌞 Where the hours stretch like melting wax And
  time plays her wicked tricks On the mind of a man.
