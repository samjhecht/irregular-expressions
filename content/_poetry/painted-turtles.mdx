<Box>
  Remember that time?  
  We painted stripes on a turtle.   
  You had gum in your hair  
  You wouldn’t let me cut it out  
  You were always that way.   
  You never let me cut your hair.   
  But you let me love you.  
  It’s strange to say,  
  But so happy all the same.  
  I remember how we lay there.  
  Or is it lie?  
  Let’s say that we lay  
  there was no lying with us,  
  Just laying and being honest  
  With each other and the world.   
  We weren’t rich   
  we weren’t poor.   
  We had enough   
  But we always wanted more.   
  I think that’s how it often is.   
  Not to say we aren’t unique,    
  I doubt there’s ever been a pair    
  That painted turtles with gum in their hair.
