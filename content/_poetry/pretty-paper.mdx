  Pretty paper thin A veil, and nothing more. Enjoy it while you’re here, It
  won’t be long before The veil Is ripped away The night dissolves the day, And
  though you will the sun to rise And you row and row against the tide The
  current is much too strong. Dear friend! There'll soon be nowhere left to
  hide!
