One day, I may go the way of Hemmingway.   
After spending a life looking for a cause worth dying for.   
And trying to muster the courage,  
mostly, to do what I had to do.   
Up until now I always deflected  
There was always more time.  
For love.   
And to make sure   
something I did in this life was worth a damn.   
But now I've lived through the moment  
All men have it.   
Maybe a gray hair, or a growing lack thereof    
And I see that my seconds are numbered.   
The worst part, interestingly enough,  
is that in experiencing this,   
I am unoriginal.   
I'm really not sure,  
Whether it's that I just want to be less old  
Or more young.   
What's more, all time is in my head.   
The universe doesn't care that I have an agenda to attend to.   
So, one day,  
I may go the way of Hemmingway.
