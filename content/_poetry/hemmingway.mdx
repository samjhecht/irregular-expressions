<div class="poem-wrapper">
One day, I may go the way of Hemmingway. <br>
After spending a life looking for a cause worth dying for. <br>
And trying to muster the courage,<br>
mostly, to do what I had to do. <br>
Up until now I always deflected<br>
There was always more time.<br>
For love. <br>
And to make sure <br>
something I did in this life was worth a damn. <br>
But now I've lived through the moment<br>
All men have it. <br>
Maybe a gray hair, or a growing lack thereof  <br>
And I see that my seconds are numbered. <br>
The worst part, interestingly enough,<br>
is that in experiencing this, <br>
I am unoriginal. <br>
I'm really not sure,<br>
Whether it's that I just want to be less old<br>
Or more young. <br>
What's more, all time is in my head. <br>
The universe doesn't care that I have an agenda to attend to. <br>
So, one day,<br>
I may go the way of Hemmingway.<br>
</div>
