The female form is exquisite   
Portioned in delicate, single-serves  
It keeps the mouth waiting,  
Salivating.   
The soul it twists in knots,  
Of yearning.  

It makes the artist dream.  
Dips and dimples.  
Lips and curls.  
Draped like a soft, silk sheet  
From a narrow, naked spine.   

But beware, bewareâ€”  
A young Aphrodite did whisper.  
The tigress lays in wait  
She knows just how to lay  
her intoxicating trap.
