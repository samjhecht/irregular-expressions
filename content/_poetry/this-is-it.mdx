This is it.  
Life.  
In all its gut wrenching glory.  
The ups.  
The downs.  
You may feel like you're sinking.  
Or like you're flying. Losing the ground.  
You'll do best to enjoy it.  
All of it.  
The highs.  
The lows.  
The pits of despair.  
Or at least appreciate it for what it is.  
Tiny waves of fleeting emotions.  
The frequencies of your own soul.  
This is as real as it gets.  
This is how you know you're alive.  
There's just so much you don't understand.  
And sometimes, when you try,  
You'll feel the weight of wonder.  
It may be more than you can bear.  
But you'll do best to try to enjoy it.  
To marvel in it.  
To let yourself be borne by it.  
And to remember,  
You are alive in it.  
That's the best feeling of all.
