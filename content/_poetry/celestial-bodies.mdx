The earth said to the sun  
"I think we should see other celestial bodies."  
The sun glared back.  
Oh, what a look that could kill!  
Silence...  
Earth spoke first, nervously—  
“It’s not you, it’s me!”  
Silence...  
Until, finally, Earth,  
realizing the Gravity of the situation,  
accepted the situation  
and said, "Perhaps...
...with some counseling  
we can get back to orbital marital bliss."
