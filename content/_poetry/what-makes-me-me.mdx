It took me a while  
to figure out who I am  
To finally feel like  
I might have a plan!  
But then just when I had it  
I realized (to my despair!)  
I was already changing  
and it didn't seem fair!  
But, as I got older  
I could finally see:  
If your goal is to "make it"  
You can never be free.  
Now I don't let them tell me  
what's the right way to be  
All this winding and weaving  
Is what makes me me!
