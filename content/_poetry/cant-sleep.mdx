I canâ€™t sleep ðŸ˜”  
And thereâ€™s not enough poetry in the world  
To tame my anxieties!  
If you were here  
That would help.   
At least Iâ€™d get to smell your pretty shampoo  
As we laid together  
Then againâ€¦  
I guess youâ€™d be smelling mine  
Given how  
Youâ€™d probably better be  
The big spoon ðŸ¥„   
Yes. That sounds right.   
I feel so damn small tonight.
