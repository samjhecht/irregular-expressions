    We came to an end  
    a few weeks ago  
    and I don't think that either was hurt.  
    But a friend of ours told me  
    that, when all was said and done,  
    you told her the root of the cause.  
    Your trepidation,  
    or reservation,  
    was not due to my looks.  
    but instead you took pause  
    when I said one of my flaws  
    is that I eat like a baby bird!  
    Oh how funny!, I thought.  
    It just goes to show!  
    How it's so hard to know  
    what moves the mind of a lover.  
    and who would have thought  
    that I would lose my shot  
    from that singular avian quality!?
