So, I recently heard it told  
That you say you’re going  
To finally unplug?  
You’re refusing to connect to the cloud?  
Are you sure  
you’ve thought this through?  
How will you know who you should be!  
If you can’t see it in your feed?  
And how will we know who you are!  
If we can’t read your tweets?  
And how will we know if you’re virtuous!  
If you don’t signal it to us  
In the comments section?  
Well, it’s your life to live. [*rolls eyes*]  
But before you go  
Consider this:  
How are you going to feel  
When you’re left with nothing  
But dusty analog books  
And when none of your advertisements  
Are personalized?
