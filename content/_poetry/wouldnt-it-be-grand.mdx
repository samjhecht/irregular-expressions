  Where should I go while my heart still works?  
  I want to go for a drive with a redhead I just met  
  In her old Ford F-150 from the 70s,  
  and visit farms and dead end roads and just laugh.  
  And just feel the wind with the windows down  
  because the air conditioning doesn’t work. Of course.  
    
  I want to rent a cabin in the woods  
  And just write.  
  But then realize the cabin was never the place.  
  That I needed to be near water.  
  And people.  
  So I go to the coast and find a town.  
  That has a bar.  
  And I just sit in that bar and write.  
  Until I’ve written something worth reading.  
  Wouldn’t that be fucking grand.  
    
  I want to go to Ireland.  
  To somewhere southwest of Cork.  
  To a little pub where good people go  
  to drink good drinks and be drunk and be happy.  
  And I’d like to play music for the good people.    
  And make almost nothing or just enough for board.  
  Either way, wouldn’t that be grand.  
    
  I want to take a trip with the love of my life,  
  and not know it’s that way until the end,  
  when it all comes smashing down to reality  
  and I see just how powerful this life can be.  
    
  I want to run with the bulls  
  and be gored but hopefully not die.  
  Dios mío! what a story!!!  
  And then spend a month on a righteous bender.  
  Making and losing beautiful memories  
  in the streets of Spain with the Spaniards.  
  You must know that would be grand?  
    
  I want go deep.   
  Really plumb the depths of my soul.  
  I want to go deep enough to marry a mermaid.  
  And it could be true love!  
  Or maybe she’d rip my heart out  
  after the most amazing aquatic love affair?  
  It would still have been worth it.  
  Just imagine the songs I could write about it...  
  And finally be a musician worthy of calling himself a musician.  
    
  Wow!! How great it feels!  
  Just to be alive.  
  Let’s hope tomorrow brings the same.  
  And if it doesn’t,  
  if instead we get the pits,  
  let’s hope we can remember  
  that we’ll be back up again.  
  That things can still be grand.
