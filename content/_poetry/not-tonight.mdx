  I finally found what I stand for And I can't stand by. Not tonight, at least.
  Not when, finally, there's a fight to be fought. I have no shortage of words
  and, In some sets of circumstances, that's a good thing. But not tonight, I'm
  afraid. Not when, after all, So much has been said by so many. I have doubts
  in my own limited ability, There's no doubt about that. Especially when so
  many have failed. And so many will fight no longer. Not tonight, maybe never.
  But with that in mind, and with all due respect, I'll finally speak my mind.
  Of the few things I believe And the even fewer that I know to be true, There
  is one thought that I am inclined to share. One mustn't be afraid to live a
  life of consequence. Not tonight.
