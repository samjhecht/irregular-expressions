  I went out to smoke a cigarette   
  That’s the measure of tonight.   
  That old pack. The one in the cabinet.   
  The one that I keep. No. Not for me!  
  The one just in case I need to be a good host.   
  Damn. It felt good.   
    
  It reminds me of Cuba. Of Havana.   
  Of breaking the rules.   
  Of being in love. With everyone around me.   
    
  I’m having another.   
  This is an unusual night.   
  So what if I have a death wish?  
  There could be worse fates  
  Than to wish a wish that you can be sure will come true.   
    
  But don’t worry  
  I don’t really want to die.   
  Not tonight, anyway.   
  I’ve got much left to do!  
  Poems to write.   
  Mountains to climb.   
  And a whole bowl of fresh peaches.
