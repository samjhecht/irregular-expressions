Do I ever think of quitting?   
Packing up and heading in?  
I used to.  Mostly.  
But I won't.  
Sometimes I think about calling it quits.  
Throwing in the towel.  
Where was I even going, anyway?  
On a quest now lost in binding loneliness?  
Some might have rightly accused me of languishing. Perhaps even lavishly.  
But those days are over now.  
Lavander√≠a is Spanish for laundromat  
And that just might have to be good enough for now.  
It's not that I'm vain.  
I never wanted to be some supermodel.  
I just always wanted to be one of those guys.  
You know the ones.  
The guys that can look good in clothes off the Walmart men's department sales rack and sunglasses from the Texaco station.  
But I digress. Look at the time.  
Back to your original question.  
Do I ever think about quitting?  
Just cashing in my chips?  
Of course. From time to time.   
It's hard not to.   
Especially when its staring you in the face.   
'Help is just a text message away',  
They say.   
And I like to think the help could really help.   
Don't you?
