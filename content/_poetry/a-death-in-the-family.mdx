  I’ve suffered a loss  
  A death in the family.   
  As is so often the case,  
  I know I had known this day would come,  
  Eventually.  Ugh.   
  Now that it’s here it’s time to reflect   
  on the time spent together.   
  Good times.    
  Passionate times.   
  Usually motivating.   
  Sometimes, soul crushing -  
  Discouragement intertwined with intense longing.   
  Always intoxicating.    
    
  For all of those days,  
  I’ll forever be grateful,  
  Albeit always a little ashamed  
  That I didn’t make better use of the time we had.   
    
  Looking back at these final years  
  And the weeks leading up to the end  
  There is some peace to temper the mourning.   
  I guess it’s solace in knowing   
  the day I’d always secretly feared  
  Has finally come.   
  The weight of keeping a secret from oneself  
  is a burden hard to bear.   
    
  So here I lift my silence  
  And like so many before  
  Admit that I am mortal  
  and that, recently,  
  my youth slipped, silently,  
  Out the back door   
  While I slept, cluelessly.   
  I’ll try to be accepting.   
  To make the best despite knowing  
  The best is not yet to come.   
    
  I’ve suffered a loss.   
  A death in the family.   
  A dream held so dearly  
  Has faded in the face of forever.   
  And from this day forward  
  I’ll be just another aging man  
  With only the dreams, dearly held,  
  Of memories that might have been.
