    I've met with success  
    but it's failure I know.  
    I woke up this morning  
    a powerful ache in my head.  
    Then in my stomach I felt that feeling of dread.  
    I prayed for a moment  
    That it had all been a dark twisted dream  
    That you still loved me  
    That things weren't as bad as they seemed.  
    I've tried to deny it, but I know that it's true  
    the worst thing that could happen to me,  
    Is the best thing that could happen to you.
