# Interactive Guide to Large Language Models

Welcome to an interactive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide will take you through the fundamentals of how these systems work, from basic concepts to practical applications.

## What You'll Learn

- How LLMs process and generate text
- Key concepts like tokens, embeddings, and attention
- Practical examples of LLM capabilities and limitations
- Hands-on demonstrations of different model behaviors

## Getting Started

This guide is designed to be interactive. As we build out the functionality, you'll be able to:

- Experiment with different prompts in real-time
- Visualize how models process text
- Compare outputs from different approaches
- Test your understanding with interactive exercises
