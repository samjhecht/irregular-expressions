I’ve started putting all these into a saved google map, but haven’t gotten everything in yet: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/edit?hl=en&hl=en&mid=1hxgIlKohj8xLxVOP6TB212UTnZA&ll=37.952253415197276%2C-79.73087204541537&z=8


Day Hikes, Swimming Holes & Waterfalls


Northern VA:
Old Rag
You can hike up it for awesome views.  Was allegedly Chris McCandless’ favorite hike (the stupid guy that got himself killed up in Alaska as made famous in “Into the Wild”).
During the fall, there’s all kinds of apple picking and apple products festivals
Fridley Gap Swimming Hole / Waterfall: 
Approximately 11 mile circuit hike with a swimming hole halfway through. Decent elevation profile though not a back breaker by any stretch. Swimming hole is NOT safe for diving. Additionally, there is a mysterious green item at the bottom that looks like a radioactive turtle. Proceed with caution.
Rapidan River
This is a great hiking and fishing area. If you go to hike, go up a few miles, the river turns comes out of a gorge that's really pretty. can get a little crowded on super nice days.
VA/WV State Line Shoulder (39.08543, -78.51044)
A very interesting out and back hike along the state border. The parking lot is on the left (if coming from dc) at the very top of the hill and is tiny and almost impossible to find if not looking. Trail is mostly doubletrack and winds along the ridge with continuous undulations. There is a geocache located on the trail as well which is pretty neat if you can find it.

Charlottesville Area:
St. Mary’s Hike & Waterfall
Drive up to this point (coordinates are 37°55'57.2"N 79°05'37.6"W). They're be a small parking lot.  you then follow the river up for an hour and a half or so before you get to an amazing swimming hole below a waterfall. there are several great swimming holes along the way.  I've never fished it, but I think it probably has some natives in there.
Kindof a tough one to get to, so be prepared for a hike. also will have to get your feet wet because the trail crosses the creek at a few points.
Relatively long hike but worth it for the waterfall at the top.  It has a deep swimming hole at the bottom that you can jump into from above the waterfall.
Hide your valuables or take them with you.  Car break-ins do happen in the parking lot
Blue Hole & Sugar Hollow
About a 45 min drive from downtown Cville.  Drive up and park by the reservoir.  You can then hike up the north fork or south fork of the moorman’s river.  Blue hole is a great swimming hole about a 45 min hike up the south fork.  
The river south of the reservoir is often stocked with trout and the reservoir itself is also stocked with lake trout a few times a year.  
Consider getting super drunk at corner bars first in Cville and then going up the North Fork skinny dipping in the middle of the night. 
There’s a great waterfall if you hike far enough up the North Fork. easy hike. lots of places to jump in and swim. Pretty fished out.
Crabtree Falls:
Absolutely beautiful. Easy hike crisscrossing beautiful waterfalls. But be careful, ~26 people have died here after trying to climb out onto the falls.  They were probably dumb lumby tourists, but even the seasoned huck finner should tread carefully. 

West of I-81:
Luray Caverns
Goshen Pass (on Maury River)
Great place to go fishing, kayaking, swimming, or just be outside.
Goshen roads, take me home...

Southwest VA:
Mt. Rogers
Highest point in VA. great hike. wild ponies roam the mountain.
VA Creeper Trail
This place is awesome.  Worth spending a day and doing the bike ride down the trail.
Used to be a train track through the mountains. they tore up the tracks and cleaned up all the trestles over all the creeks and rivers and now you can drive to damascus, rent a bike, get a ride up the mountain and take a leisurely bike ride down the trail through some beautiful country.
The trail ends right down in Damascus. 



Camping


West of I-81:
Lake Moomaw area
Hidden Treasure of VA. Would be a great place to get a group of people together, rent a pontoon boat or two and camp out on one of the little islands.
Hidden Valley of the Jackson

Southwest VA:


Bed & Breakfasts

Fort Lewis Lodge
Great bed and breakfast out in Bath County, VA. Tons of stuff to do in the area, including fishing, swimming, hiking, caving, and you're only a 30 minute drive from the Homestead, where you could go play golf or go to the hot springs.
